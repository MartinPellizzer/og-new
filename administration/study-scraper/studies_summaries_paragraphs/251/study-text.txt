Here is a summarized paragraph focusing on the ozone-related information and data, within the 60-80 word limit:

The study simulated the ozone distribution on TRAPPIST-1e, a rocky exoplanet orbiting an M dwarf star. The model revealed a North-South asymmetry in the ozone (O3) distribution, with highest concentrations below 10 hPa near the South pole. The total ozone column density was higher on TRAPPIST-1e compared to Earth, reaching 8000 Dobson Units near the South pole and 2000 DU near the North pole. This asymmetry resulted from the presence of land masses on the night side influencing atmospheric circulation.
