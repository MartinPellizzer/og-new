The results showed that O3 exposure was positively associated with longitudinal IR markers, and the proportions of RTL mediated these associations ranged from 11.92% to 60.36%. Furthermore, a mouse model experiment revealed that O3-exposed mice exhibited telomere shortening, decreased telomerase reverse transcriptase activity, and upregulation of GSK-3Î² and G-6-Pase expression at mRNA levels.
