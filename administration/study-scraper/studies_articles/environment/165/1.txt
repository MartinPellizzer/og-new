The study utilized data from the main cities of the Lombardy region in Italy, which was obtained from the National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT) and the Regional Agency for the Protection of the Environment (ARPA). The daily 8h maximum ozone concentration and hourly resolution data were used to evaluate the short- and long-term association between ozone concentration and total mortality. The study employed FDA-based models to capture the complexity of the weather-health relationship, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of the dynamic interplay between air pollution and its effects on human health.
