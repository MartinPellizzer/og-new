Introduction

Ozone pollution is a significant environmental issue that affects public health and the economy. The Sichuan Basin in China is one of the most polluted regions due to its complex topography and high population density. Understanding the contribution of different factors to ozone formation is crucial for effective air quality management. This study aims to quantify the contributions of meteorological chemical formation, vertical transport, and horizontal transport to air quality during spring and summer in different regions of the Sichuan Basin.

Methods

The Community Multi-scale Air Quality (CMAQ) model with the Integrated Process Rate (IPR) was employed to simulate the months of April and July 2021 in the Sichuan Basin. The CMAQ model is a widely used air quality modeling system that simulates the formation of ground-level ozone. The IPR scheme is a physical parameterization that calculates the rate of chemical reactions and transport processes. The simulated results were validated against observations from monitoring stations to ensure accuracy.

Results

The results show that both the spring and summer chemical formation of ozone in the urban centre exhibit negative values, while the surrounding urban areas contribute positively, with chemical formation ranging from 0 to 10 μg·m−3. The maximum ozone level due to horizontal transport in the urban centre exceeds 20 μg·m−3, whereas horizontal transport in the surrounding urban areas exhibits negative values, with transport contributions concentrated within the range of −5 to 0 μg·m−3. Vertical transport in the central and southern parts of the basin shows positive values, with transport contributions ranging from 0 to 10 μg·m−3.

Discussion

The study highlights the importance of vertical and horizontal transport in ozone formation in the Sichuan Basin. The results suggest that chemical formation is not the dominant factor in ozone pollution, but rather it is the combination of meteorological conditions and transport processes. The study also emphasizes the need for effective air quality management strategies that consider the complex interactions between atmospheric chemistry and meteorology.

Conclusions

In conclusion, this study demonstrates the significance of vertical and horizontal transport in ozone formation in the Sichuan Basin. The results provide valuable insights into the complex processes governing ozone pollution in this region. Effective air quality management strategies should take into account the interplay between atmospheric chemistry and meteorology to mitigate ozone pollution. Future studies should continue to investigate the impacts of climate change on ozone pollution and develop more accurate models for predicting air quality.
