Here are the five detailed paragraphs using the information from the scientific study:

**Paragraph 1**
Fly ash is a type of solid waste generated in power plants that has been increasingly used as a catalyst carrier to enhance its value-added potential. In this study, we produced a catalyst composed of MnOx/NiOOH supported on fly ash by directly employing nickel hydroxide and potassium permanganate to generate metal active sites over the fly ash surface while simultaneously creating a larger specific surface area and pore structure. The catalytic ozonation performance of this catalyst was evaluated using sodium acetate as the target organic matter.

**Paragraph 2**
The synthesis of the catalyst was carried out by pretreating the fly ash with hydrochloric acid, followed by drying at 60 degrees Celsius. Then, the acidified fly ash was used as the carrier for Ni-Mn loading, and the synthetic catalyst was named x-NiyMn1−yOOH/ACFA, where x represents the wt.% of Ni-Mn atoms on the surface of ACFA, and y/1-y represents the different Ni/Mn ratios. The catalysts were synthesized with various ratios of Ni/Mn at 1:5, 4:2, and 5:1, and wt.% of Ni-Mn atoms at 8%, 20%, and 30%, respectively.

**Paragraph 3**
The experimental results demonstrated that an optimal removal efficiency of 57.5% for sodium acetate was achieved using the 0.2-Ni0.67Mn0.33OOH/ACFA catalyst, surpassing even that of MnOx/NiOOH supported catalyst by using γ-Al2O3. The reaction process parameters, including varying concentrations of ozone, sodium acetate, and catalyst dosage, as well as pH value and the quantitative analysis of formed free radicals, were examined in detail.

**Paragraph 4**
The presence of numerous hydroxyl groups on the surface of hydroxyl oxide facilitates the adsorption of ozone onto the catalyst surface and enhances the activation of ozone molecules into active oxygen species. This leads to an expedited degradation of organic pollutants. The synthesis of metal hydroxyl oxides bypasses the high-temperature calcination process required for synthesizing metal oxides, which creates new opportunities for simple, environmentally friendly, and low-cost methods to degrade organic pollutants.

**Paragraph 5**
In conclusion, this study demonstrates that fly ash can be used as a viable catalytic material for wastewater treatment. The synthesized catalysts exhibited excellent catalytic ozonation performance for the degradation of sodium acetate, which is a common terminal intermediate in the oxidative degradation process of organic pollutants by ozone. The results provide new insights into the potential applications of metal hydroxyl oxides in water treatment research and highlight the importance of exploring alternative methods for wastewater treatment that are environmentally friendly and cost-effective.
