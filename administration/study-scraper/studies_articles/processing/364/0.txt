The conservation of historical textiles is a significant challenge for conservators due to the natural fading and damage caused by aging. Natural dyes used in pre-synthetic era fabrics are particularly prone to deterioration, posing difficulties when cleaning, preserving, or displaying these valuable artifacts. To address this issue, researchers have developed various methods to create artificial samples that mimic the conditions of historical textiles. One such approach is using UV/Ozone accelerated aging technique to prepare artificial deteriorated standard dyed woolen samples for textile conservation purposes.
