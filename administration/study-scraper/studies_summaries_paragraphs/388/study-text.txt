Here is a summary of the study in 1 detailed paragraph, focusing on ozone-related information and data:

The study examines the relationship between solar irradiance and Earth's environment, including the stratospheric ozone layer. Over the past century, changes in solar irradiance have been suggested to cause climate change, with some estimates indicating a significant fraction of industrial-era warming, while others propose it may be undetectable. The research uses over 40 years of space-based observations and advanced modeling techniques to quantify the Sun's role in global climate change, ozone depletion and recovery. According to the study, changes in solar irradiance affect Earth's energy balance, influencing the formation and destruction of stratospheric ozone.
