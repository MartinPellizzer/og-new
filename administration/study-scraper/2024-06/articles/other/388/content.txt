Here are five detailed paragraphs based on the scientific study:

**Paragraph 1**
The study investigated the behavior of atmospheric pollutants under different synoptic situations in two locations in Havana. The concentrations of sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and ozone (O3) were monitored at automatic weather stations from November 2015 to October 2016. Understanding the relationships between atmospheric pollutants and synoptic situations is essential for developing effective air quality management strategies. In this study, we aimed to determine how different synoptic situations influence the concentration of these pollutants in Havana.

**Paragraph 2**
The study employed a observational approach, collecting hourly concentrations of SO2, NOx, and O3 from two automatic weather stations in Havana. The data were grouped according to the prevailing synoptic situation, which was determined using satellite imagery and meteorological records. Kruskal-Wallis H-test and Dunn's test were used to analyze the relationship between pollutant concentrations and synoptic situations.

**Paragraph 3**
The results showed that the highest mean concentration of SO2 and NOx occurred when the stations were under the influence of weak subtropical Atlantic anticyclones and migratory continental high-pressure systems. In contrast, ozone concentrations peaked during periods of high atmospheric pressure. The study also found significant variations in pollutant concentrations between different synoptic situations.

**Paragraph 4**
The findings suggest that synoptic situations play a crucial role in determining pollutant concentrations in Havana. The study highlights the importance of considering meteorological factors when developing air quality management strategies. The results also underscore the need for further research on the relationships between atmospheric pollutants and synoptic situations in order to improve our understanding of this complex issue.

**Paragraph 5**
In conclusion, this study provides valuable insights into the behavior of atmospheric pollutants under different synoptic situations in Havana. The findings have important implications for air quality management in urban areas. By considering the relationships between pollutant concentrations and synoptic situations, policymakers can develop more effective strategies to mitigate the impacts of air pollution on public health and the environment.
