Abstract: Refrigerants used in the commercial equipment of supermarkets are the object of the research. The Montreal Protocol calls for a complete phase-out of hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) by 2030, and the Kigali Amendment regulates the use of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) from 2019. Developed countries began phasing out HFC use in 2019, while developing countries plan to freeze HFC consumption from 2024. These global efforts are aimed at reducing the depletion of the ozone layer and combating climate change. The number of supermarkets in the world varies greatly: in Europe they number from 110 thousand to 115 thousand, and in China – from 65 thousand to 70 thousand, which reflects various needs in refrigeration equipment. Stringent environmental regulations are forcing the commercial refrigeration sector to remain globally competitive. Modernization of supermarkets using natural refrigerants is important for solving emerging challenges. The results of the study show significant improvements in energy efficiency ratio (EER) and coefficient of performance (COP) when using a mixture of hydrocarbons (R290: 85 %, R600a: 15 %) compared to traditional refrigerants R404a, R449a and R502. Specifically, at the evaporation temperature of T<sub>evap</sub>=–10 °C, EER increased by 38–44 % and COP by 26–31 % compared to R404a and R449a, respectively. At T<sub>evap</sub>=–25 °C, EER increased by 17–34 % and COP by 2–22 % compared to R404a and R449a. Additionally, compared to R502, the hydrocarbon blend showed a 38–44 % increase in EER and 28–31 % COP at Tevap=–10 °C, and a 17–34 % increase in EER and 5–22 % COP at T<sub>evap</sub>=–25 °C. These results highlight the advantages of the hydrocarbon mixture at different evaporation temperatures, indicating its potential to improve energy efficiency in refrigeration applications. The obtained data suggest the possibility of a wider application of the mixture of hydrocarbons in commercial refrigeration plants, offering both improved performance and compliance with safety regulations.
