Here are five detailed paragraphs based on the scientific study:

**Paragraph 1: Introduction**
The study focuses on the impact of reducing nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from agricultural sources on stratospheric ozone (O3). N2O is a potent greenhouse gas that has risen significantly in the atmosphere over the past century, with agricultural activities being the main contributor to its growth. Reducing N2O emissions could have both climate benefits and implications for O3 recovery.

**Paragraph 2: Methods**
The study uses the UKESM1 Earth System model to simulate the effects of N2O reductions on stratospheric O3 across two different future scenarios, SSP3-7.0 and SSP1-2.6. The simulations are run with fully interactive tropospheric and stratospheric chemistry, allowing for a comprehensive examination of the impact of N2O emission reductions on O3. The study also uses spatially separate deployment of nitrification inhibitors and crushed basalt to reduce N2O emissions from agricultural sources.

**Paragraph 3: Results**
The results show that reducing N2O emissions leads to decreases in low-altitude concentrations, which propagate vertically as N2O enters the stratosphere. This reduction in N2O leads to increased annual mean stratospheric O3 mixing ratios, particularly around mid-latitudes and tropics. The increases persist throughout all seasons, with statistical significance observed in the SSP370_low_N2O vs. SSP370 comparison.

**Paragraph 4: Discussion**
The study suggests that the increase in stratospheric O3 is driven by the reduction of NOx-driven O3 loss, which is the main driver of O3 change. The results also show that the reduction in N2O emissions leads to a decrease in total reactive nitrogen (NOy), which further supports the attribution of the O3 changes to NOx-driven O3 loss.

**Paragraph 5: Conclusion**
In conclusion, reducing N2O emissions from agricultural sources can lead to beneficial impacts on stratospheric O3. The study highlights the importance of considering the interplay between climate and atmospheric chemistry when designing strategies for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. The results suggest that targeted agricultural N2O emission reductions could be an effective way to achieve net-zero emissions while also supporting O3 recovery.
