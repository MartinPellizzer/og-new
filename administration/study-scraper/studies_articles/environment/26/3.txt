The increasing trend of surface O3 concentrations in China is attributed to the growing emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and nitrogen oxides (NOx), which are primary precursors of O3. Our findings highlight the need for effective control measures to reduce VOC and NOx emissions, particularly in urban areas. Furthermore, our study suggests that fine-scale estimations can be used to identify high-risk areas for O3 pollution and inform targeted policy interventions.
