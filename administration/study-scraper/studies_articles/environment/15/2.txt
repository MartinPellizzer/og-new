The results of the analysis revealed a significant correlation between the geomagnetic index Ap, total ozone content, and COVID-19 incidence. The study found that periods of high solar activity, characterized by increased geomagnetic disturbances and reduced TO levels, coincided with heightened COVID-19 cases around the world. Conversely, periods of low solar activity were associated with decreased COVID-19 cases.
