**Paragraph 1**

Climate change is a pressing global issue that requires innovative solutions to mitigate its effects. One such approach is Stratospheric Aerosol Injection (SAI), which involves injecting aerosols into the lower stratosphere to reflect sunlight and reduce global warming. However, the effectiveness of SAI depends on various factors, including the latitude of injection. This study aims to investigate how the latitude of SO2 injection affects the climate in UKESM1, a Earth system model.

**Paragraph 2**

The researchers used four different scenarios to isolate the role of latitude in SAI: injection at the equator (EQ), and injection at 15° N and S (15N+15S), at 30° N and S (30N+30S), and at 60° N and S (60N+60S). The same global-mean temperature target, altitude of injection, and hemispherically symmetric injection rates were used in all scenarios. The UKESM1 model was used to simulate the climate outcomes of each scenario.

**Paragraph 3**

The results show that injecting SO2 at the equator leads to several undesirable side effects, including a residual Arctic warming, significant reduction in tropical precipitation, and reductions in high-latitude ozone. In contrast, injection at the subtropics (15 and 30° N and S) is more efficient, requiring less SO2 injection for the same amount of cooling. Injection at 60° N and S requires only 30% more SO2 injection than the 30N+30S scenario.

**Paragraph 4**

The study highlights the importance of considering the latitude of SAI in climate modeling. The results demonstrate that different latitudes have distinct effects on the climate, including changes in precipitation patterns, ozone levels, and stratospheric temperature gradients. The researchers emphasize that the most efficient injection location is the subtropics, which has fewer negative side effects compared to other scenarios.

**Paragraph 5**

In conclusion, this study underscores the importance of considering the latitude of SAI in climate modeling. The findings suggest that injecting SO2 at the subtropics (15 and 30° N and S) may be a more effective and efficient strategy for mitigating global warming. The results also highlight the need to balance cooling with other environmental concerns, such as ozone depletion and changes in precipitation patterns. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the complex relationships between SAI, latitude, and climate outcomes.
