**Paragraph 1**

A recent study published in Lancet Regional Health – Europe has shed light on the short and mid-term impact of ozone (O3) on myocardial infarction (MI) incidence in Poland. The researchers aimed to investigate the relationship between O3 concentrations and the incidence of ST-elevation MI (STEMI) and non-ST-elevation MI (NSTEMI) in rural and urban areas. The study's findings have significant implications for public health policy and environmental protection initiatives.

**Paragraph 2**

The researchers used a previously described methodology to analyze data on O3 concentrations in individual counties within the analyzed area over a period of time. They also examined the association between exposure to O3 and STEMI and NSTEMI incidence using relative risk (RR) estimates. The study controlled for other pollutants, such as particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 microns (PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and benzoalphapyrene (BaP).

**Paragraph 3**

The results showed that the median concentration of O3 was 47.9 μg/m3, with significant seasonal and geographical variability. The study found a positive association between exposure to O3 and STEMI incidence on the day of exposure (RR 1.007, 95% CI 1.001–1.013, P = 0.026), especially in rural areas (RR 1.009, 95% CI 1.002–1.016, P = 0.009). In contrast, there was no significant association between O3 exposure and NSTEMI incidence.

**Paragraph 4**

The study's findings are consistent with previous research highlighting the adverse effects of O3 on cardiovascular disease (CVD) and myocardial infarction. The results suggest that integrating environmental risk factors into established risk assessment scales may be necessary to prevent CVD in high-risk populations. Furthermore, the study underscores the importance of extending mitigation strategies to encompass less urbanized areas.

**Paragraph 5**

In conclusion, this study provides valuable insights into the relationship between O3 concentrations and myocardial infarction incidence in Poland. The findings support the need for further research on the impact of air pollution on cardiovascular health, particularly in rural areas where O3 levels may be higher. Public health policy initiatives should consider implementing measures to reduce O3 concentrations and mitigate its negative effects on cardiovascular disease.
