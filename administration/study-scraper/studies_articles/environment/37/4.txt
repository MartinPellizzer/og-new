In conclusion, this study demonstrates the feasibility of using ozone to treat VOCs such as 1,2-dichlorobenzene. The results show that the reaction between 1,2-dichlorobenzene and ozone leads to the formation of products containing C=O and O-H functional groups, which may be indicative of a condensation reaction. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanism of this reaction and explore its potential applications in environmental pollution control.
