The study's results show that dry lightning is increasingly associated with large and severe wildfires in the WUS. Moreover, it was found that the largest population exposure to co-occurring air pollution was linked to the major outbreak of dry lightning that ignited hundreds of wildfires in California during August, 2020. The researchers also identified four types of meteorological patterns associated with the largest dry lightning outbreaks over central and northern California.
