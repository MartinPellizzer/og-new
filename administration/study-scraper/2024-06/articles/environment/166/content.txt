Here are five detailed paragraphs summarizing the scientific study:

**Paragraph 1**
Air pollution is a major public health concern worldwide, particularly in developing countries. In Rwanda, there has been a significant gap in air quality monitoring data, hindering efforts to address this issue effectively. To address this gap, a team of researchers deployed low-cost, real-time monitors for particulate matter (PM2.5) and black carbon (BC) in Kigali, Rwanda's capital city. The study aimed to investigate the spatial and temporal variability of air pollutants in Kigali, as well as their sources and effects on health.

**Paragraph 2**
The researchers used a combination of low-cost monitors and standard gravimetric methods to measure PM2.5 concentrations. They also compared the data with readings from certified CO and O3 monitors at Rwanda's climate observatory on Mount Mugogo. The study took place over a period of 16 months, from March 2017 to July 2018. The researchers analyzed the data using spatial and temporal statistical models to identify patterns and trends in PM2.5 and BC concentrations.

**Paragraph 3**
The results showed that the average PM2.5 concentration in Kigali was 52 micrograms per cubic meter, significantly exceeding the World Health Organization's (WHO) intermediate target level of 1 microgram per cubic meter. The researchers also found that BC concentrations were moderate to high, comparable to those in urban areas of India and China. The data revealed significant spatial variations in PM2.5 concentrations between different urban background sites in Kigali, but moderate correlations with PM2.5 on Mount Mugogo.

**Paragraph 4**
The study's findings highlight the importance of understanding the sources of air pollution in Kigali. The researchers identified local sources as responsible for at least half of the atmospheric PM2.5 during wet seasons and one-quarter during dry seasons. They also found that restrictions on vehicle movement on Sundays reduced PM2.5 and BC concentrations by 10-12 micrograms per cubic meter and 1 microgram per cubic meter, respectively. The study's results suggest that policy measures aimed at reducing emissions from local sources could have significant impacts on improving air quality in Kigali.

**Paragraph 5**
Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of low-cost sensors to monitor air pollution in real-time, particularly in resource-constrained settings. The findings highlight the need for continued monitoring and research to inform effective policies aimed at reducing air pollution and its health impacts in Kigali and other cities in sub-Saharan Africa.
