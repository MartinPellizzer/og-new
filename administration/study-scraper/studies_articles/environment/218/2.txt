The results show that there is a clear demarcation between the upper and lower stratosphere in terms of QBO-induced ozone perturbations. In the upper stratosphere (above 20-hPa), the ozone perturbations are predicted by the steady-state response of the ozone column to temperature changes, while those in the lower stratosphere show no temperature response and are likely driven by circulation changes. These findings have important implications for diagnosing model-model differences in QBO-ozone responses for climate projections.
