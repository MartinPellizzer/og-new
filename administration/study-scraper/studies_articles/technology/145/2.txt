The results of the study showed that the complete removal of B. atrophaeus was achieved for both non-compacted and compacted infectious medical waste with contact times of 15 and 50 minutes, respectively. The efficiency of ozone injection through a glass column was 100% in 30 minutes, while separate injection of water vapor into the contact tank achieved 100% removal in 50 minutes. These findings indicate that ozone technology is effective in inactivating microbial agents in medical solid waste.
