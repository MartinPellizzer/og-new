In conclusion, this study highlights the importance of surface reactions in ozone destruction and demonstrates a method for manipulating the pseudo first-order rate constant by controlling the surface condition. The results have implications for developing effective strategies to mitigate ozone destruction and provide a foundation for further research into the reaction mechanisms involved.
