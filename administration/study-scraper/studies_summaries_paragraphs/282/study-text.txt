Here is a summary of the study in one paragraph, focusing on information and data related to ozone:

This study examines the causal relationships between air pollution risk factors and their effects on health in an industrial zone. The results show that complex industrial and port activities, along with hydrogen sulfide, benzene, sulfur dioxide, and PM10 emissions, are significant causes of air pollution risks for health. Furthermore, these factors lead to increased levels of ozone (O3), carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, and PM2.5 in the atmosphere, which negatively impact public health. The study also identifies hospitals, elderly residences, schools, industrial installations, roads, urban cores, natural areas, agriculture, and waterways as affected by other factors. Control measures such as reducing emissions from complex industrial activities and port operations can help mitigate the effects of air pollution on health.
