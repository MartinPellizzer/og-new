CHAPTER NINE

CONCEPTUAL REVIEW OF ENVIRONMENTAL RISK

AND DISASTER MANAGEMENT

Ahmad
 Said Abubakar and
 Saadatu Ibrahim

 INTRODUCTION

T
he French verb ‘
environ
’, which means
 to encircle or surround, is the

source of the English word "
environment
" (Abubakar, 2014). Our

surroundings, which include the air, water
 and
 al
l living and
 non
-
living

objects combine to
 shape who we ar
e and how we live (Whiston, 2000;

Umar, 2009
; Olofin, 2009; Moriki, 2009). We obtain food to eat, water

to drink, air to breathe
 and
 all other essentials for our way of life from the

surroundings.
 In
 our
 effort
s
 to
 meet
 the
 needs
 of
 an
 expanding

population, humans now have a substantial impact on the environment

through the extraction of minerals, the use of energy
 and
 the emission of

pollutants. The systems that sustain life are being undermined by

pollution and
 overuse. For centuries to come, the ozone layer will

continue to be destroyed by C
hloro
 F
louro
 C
arbon
s
 (CFCs)
 in the

atmosphere today. A species is lost forever once it goes extinct. We need

to work more to enhance environmental quality and be conscious o
f the

negative effects of unsustainable development.

Environmental risks have a wide range of effects, including physical,

socio
-
political
 and economic issues. For example, the average yearly

death toll from natural catastrophes is about 150,000
 and
 the an
nual

economic losses are more than $5
0 billion (Keller &
 Blodgett, 2007).

.1 RISK

Risk can be defined as the probability of negative outcomes, such as

casualties, property damage, economic disruption
 and
 environmental

harm, resulting from the interaction
 of natural or human
-
induced hazards
