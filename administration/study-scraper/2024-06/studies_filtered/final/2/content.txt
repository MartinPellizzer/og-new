Abstract
Ornamental nursery stocks rely on soil fumigants to combat soilborne pathogens, diseases, and weeds, which all pose significant challenges to tree seedling production in the ornamental industry. Methyl bromide, a broad-spectrum soil fumigant, effectively targets weeds, soilborne fungi, and nematodes. Despite its efficacy, its classification as a potent ozone-depleting substance has led to its gradual phase-out in agricultural practices. Pulse electric field (PEF) technology has emerged as a promising innovation with the potential to address multiple challenges posed by methyl bromide.
