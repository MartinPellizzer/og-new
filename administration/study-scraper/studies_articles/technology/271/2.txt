The results showed that the electrocoagulation reactor achieved a removal efficiency of 92% for total suspended solids (TSS) and 10% for chemical oxygen demand (COD). The ozonation tank further reduced COD by 18%. However, despite these treatments, EC50 values indicated acute toxicity in all three samples. The germination index (GI) values did not show significant differences between the three samples, suggesting that toxicity did not decrease substantially with treatment.
