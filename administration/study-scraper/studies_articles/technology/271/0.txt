The assessment of toxicity is a crucial step in evaluating the effectiveness of wastewater treatment processes. The study conducted by Aguilar-Ascon et al. aimed to evaluate the toxicity of tannery effluents treated with electrocoagulation and ozonation using Lactuca sativa L. lettuce seeds as bioassay organisms. The primary objective was to determine the suitability of these treatments for application in wastewater treatment, while maintaining the environmental quality of receiving water bodies.
