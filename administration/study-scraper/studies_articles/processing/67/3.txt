The results demonstrate the importance of optimizing process parameters to achieve efficient surface removal and decontamination. The study highlights the critical role of ozone in regenerating cerium (IV) ions, which is essential for effective corrosion. The findings also emphasize the need to consider the geometry of stainless steel components, as curved surfaces or weld joints may require special treatment.
