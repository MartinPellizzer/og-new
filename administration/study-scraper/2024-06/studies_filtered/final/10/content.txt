Abstract
Fungal infections pose a challenge in cereal grains, with Fusarium species, especially in malting barley, causing substantial economic losses and quality degradation. We investigated the effect of gaseous ozone on fungal deactivation and grain germination in spring malting barley, with focus on Fusarium spp. Five studies were performed: (1) ozone concentration (10–100 ppm) and exposure time (1–24 h) on high-moisture barley (19.8%); (2) ozone-treated barley stability over 120 days at 4 °C; (3) grain moisture content (12–20%); (4) relative humidity (23%, 54%, and 98%); and (5) temperature (13 °C, 20 °C, and 33 °C). Significant reductions in total fungal count and Fusarium spp. across all treatments were observed. Higher ozone concentrations and longer exposure times yielded greater reductions, with 100 ppm for 24 h achieving 99.2% and 98.2% reductions in total fungal count and Fusarium incidence, respectively. Grain germination exhibited a negative dose-dependent response but remained within recommended values. Ozone-treated barley preserved quality for 60 days in storage. Grain moisture content, relative humidity, and temperature did not significantly affect ozone's efficacy on fungi and grain germination. This study demonstrates ozone's efficacy against fungi while preserving barley germination, suggesting it as an eco-friendly fungicidal alternative.

1. Introduction
Cereal grains are essential staples in the global food supply. They may host a diverse and dynamic array of microorganisms, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses (
Noots et al., 1999
). Among these, fungi are the most abundant and are primarily responsible for spoilage in cereal grains (
Różewicz et al., 2021
). Despite the use of fungicides and genetic resistant varieties, fungal infections still lead to significant losses throughout the entire cereal production chain, from field to storage, estimated to be at least 20% of total production worldwide (
Radzikowski et al., 2023
). These losses can vary significantly between regions, influenced by factors such as climate, agricultural practices, storage conditions, and economic infrastructures. Regions with warm and humid conditions exacerbate fungal infections, and with ongoing global warming, the incidence and severity of these infections are expected to rise, further jeopardizing food security (
Nnadi and Carter, 2021
). These infections also reduce grain quality and market value due to discolorations, blights, and reduced germination (
Pitt and Hocking, 2009
;
Różewicz et al., 2021
). Moreover, fungal infections pose food safety risks, as many fungal species produce mycotoxins, secondary metabolites highly toxic to humans and livestock (
Różewicz et al., 2021
).
Malting barley, valued for its premium quality, must meet strict quality standards including absence of fungal diseases (
Kunze, 2019
). Fusarium and Alternaria are among the most common fungal genera found in the barley fields, while Penicillium and Aspergillus predominantly develop during storage (
Noots et al., 1999
). Fusarium species notably impact the quality of barley grain, malt, and beer (
Jin et al., 2018
). Besides producing mycotoxins that persist through malting and brewing processes, Fusarium aggravates quality defects such as reduced seed germination, altered beer colour and flavour, and beer gushing (
Jin et al., 2018
;
Mastanjević et al., 2017
;
Oliveira et al., 2012
).
Traditionally, post-harvest grains have been dried and treated with synthetic preservatives like triazoles to prevent fungal growth (
Jørgensen and Heick, 2021
). While very effective, the use of fungicides in modern agriculture has resulted in fungal resistance, human health risks due to exposure to the fungicides and their toxic by-products, water pollution, and other environmental hazards (
Kontoyiannis and Lewis, 2002
;
Lucas et al., 2015
;
Zubrod et al., 2019
). This highlights the urgent need for new, effective, safe, and environmentally friendly grain disinfectant technologies.
Ozone (O3) is a potent oxidant with antimicrobial properties (
Brodowska et al., 2017
). Its non-residual nature, breaking down into oxygen without direct by-products, reduces health risks and environmental impact compared to traditional fungicides. Noteworthy, its high reactivity can potentially generate toxic by-products under specific conditions and product nature, necessitating further research for product safety assurance. Ozone's mechanism of action against microorganisms involves oxidizing and disrupting various constituents of the cell outer layers, leading to cell lysis (
Khadre et al., 2001
). This broad-spectrum oxidative action reduces the likelihood of fungal resistance (
Pascual et al., 2007
).
Ozone, both in aqueous and gaseous forms, is currently used for surface decontamination, water purification, and treating various food products. Previous research has demonstrated its fungicidal efficacy in cereal grains and derivatives, including Fusarium species (
Allen et al., 2003
;
Beber-Rodrigues et al., 2015
;
Mylona et al., 2014
;
Piacentini et al., 2017
;
Santos et al., 2016
;
Savi et al., 2014
;
Trombete et al., 2017
;
Wu et al., 2006
). However, ozone's oxidative power, beneficial for inactivating microorganisms, may unintentionally damage grain components, potentially affecting crucial processes such as seed germination, vital for planting and brewing. Research has indicated a dose-dependent effect on germination, with low doses enhancing it and high doses reducing it (
Allen et al., 2003
;
Violleau et al., 2008
;
Wu et al., 2006
).
Furthermore, ozone treatment presents economic advantages by eliminating ongoing expenses linked to traditional methods, like purchasing, storing, and disposing of chemical agents like fungicides. Instead, it uses on-site generated ozone from atmospheric air. However, initial adoption may require substantial investments in specialized equipment and facility adjustments to ensure safe operations. Adequate training of personnel is also essential to comply with health and safety standards, given the potential hazards of ozone at high concentrations.
The efficacy of ozone in reducing microbial load is directly associated with grain moisture content, relative humidity, and temperature (
Khadre et al., 2001
), yet their complex interactions remain underexplored. A high-water environment enhances ozone efficacy because it promotes the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) like superoxide anion (O2‾·), hydroperoxyl radical (HO2·), and hydroxyl radical (·OH), which enhance disinfection power (
Han et al., 2002
;
Khadre et al., 2001
;
Zhao and Cranston, 1995
). Additionally, water accelerates ozone reactivity by facilitating increased contact with grains and gas (
Savi et al., 2014
). The effects of ozone become negligible below 45% relative humidity (
Elford and Van Den Ende, 1942
) and below 18% grain moisture content (
Raila et al., 2006
). On the other hand, temperature plays a crucial role in the solubility, stability, and reactivity of ozone. While ozone becomes more reactive with increasing temperatures, it also becomes less stable (
Coll Cárdenas et al., 2011
;
Khadre et al., 2001
). Wet and warm conditions, which are detrimental for storage of grains, can paradoxically enhance ozone treatment efficacy. While this presents a challenge for ozone disinfection during storage of dry grains, it opens opportunities for post-harvest treatment during drying.
To optimize postharvest ozone treatment of malting barley, a comprehensive investigation is required to understand the influence of key factors. This study focuses on malting barley, mainly under high-moisture environments, to enhance ozone treatment efficacy and replicate the elevated moisture levels in freshly harvested barley. Ozone concentration, exposure time, grain moisture content, relative humidity, temperature, and storage stability are examined to assess their impact on fungal and Fusarium spp. reduction, alongside grain germination. These findings will be instrumental for future implementations and refinements in utilizing gaseous ozone to treat other cereal crops.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Barley samples
Spring malting barley (RGT Planet; 100 kg) was collected from the University of Copenhagen farm “Højbakkegård” (Taastrup, Denmark) in August 2019. The barley (moisture content = 9.0% ± 0.3%; water activity = 0.42 ± 0.02) was packed in 25-kg cotton bulk bags and stored within an enclosed plastic container at 4 °C before use. The fungal load on the barley resulted solely from natural contamination during growing, harvesting, precleaning, and drying.
2.2. Ozonation unit
The ozonation of barley was carried out inside a specially designed, custom-made, air-tight polycarbonate box measuring 60 × 40 × 30 cm (
Fig. S1
). Ozone was generated within the box using a UV Excimer lamp at 172 nm (model: UXFLUST 16L160 – 01A; power: 17 W; Ushio America; Cypress, USA) and continuously monitored by an ozone monitor (model: 108-L; 2B Technologies; Colorado, USA), measuring ozone concentrations in parts per million (ppm). The setup maintained a constant ozone concentration during treatment using a PID (proportional integral derivative) control system. This system regulated the operation of the UV lamp and monitored ozone levels to ensure consistent ozone concentrations. To achieve uniform ozone distribution and maximize exposure, an integrated fan facilitated ozone circulation within the chamber. Additionally, barley grains were arranged in a single layer (7 mm) on stainless steel grain test sieves (20 cm diameter and 1 mm mesh aperture) to ensure consistent treatment across samples. Test sieves were positioned on two stainless-steel grids, with the first grid placed 10 cm above a saturated salt slurry (see section
2.3
. below). The relative humidity was regulated by selected saturated salt slurries and monitored by a hygrometer (model: ES 991; LS Control; Herlufmagle, Denmark) affixed to the box. Temperature was monitored by a temperature data-logger (model: Hygrolog HL-1D; Rotronic; Bassersdorf, Switzerland) situated on the outside the ozonation unit due to incompatibility with ozone. Most experiments were conducted at room temperature 20 °C ± 1 °C), with additional investigations at 13 °C (±1 °C) and 33 °C (±1 °C), achieved using cold and heated rooms. After each experiment, the UV lamp was turned off and any residual ozone was safely released into a fume hood using two exhaust valves before the box was opened.
2.3. Saturated salt slurries
To maintain specific relative humidity levels within the ozonation unit, saturated salt slurries of potassium sulphate (K2SO4; Merck KGaA; Darmstadt, Germany), magnesium nitrate (Mg(NO3)2 · 6H₂O; Merck KGaA; Darmstadt, Germany), and potassium acetate (CH3COOK; Merck KGaA; Darmstadt, Germany) were utilized. These salts were chosen based on their theoretical relative humidity of 97.6% (±0.5%), 54.4% (±0.2%), and 23.1% (±0.3%), respectively, at 20 °C (
Fontana, 2007
). Slurries were prepared with approximately 500 g of salts to cover the surface of the glass container (40 × 30 × 7 cm), ensuring a large ratio of salt slurry to the sample. The solid salts were lightly moistened with distilled water to achieve dampness while preventing complete dissolution.
2.4. Moisture content and water activity of grains
Grain moisture content was determined using a halogen moisture analyser (model: HR73; Mettler Toledo; Columbus OH, USA), while water activity was determined with a portable analyser (model: Hygropalm-HP23-AW-A; Rotronic; Bassersdorf, Switzerland). Measurements were conducted in triplicate.
2.5. Barley moisture content adjustment
Barley grains were placed in sterile air-tight containers and rehydrated with sterile distilled water to reach the target moisture content following the method described by
Ramakrishna et al. (1993)
. The volume of water required for rehydration was calculated using the formulae: v =
, where v is the volume of water to be added (mL), w is the weight of grains to be treated (g), a is the desired moisture content of the grain (%), b is the initial moisture content of the grain (%), and I is the volume of water added with the inoculum (mL). In this case, the inoculation volume (I) was zero, as no inoculation was performed. The rehydrated barley samples were then sealed and stored at 4 °C for 5 days, with regular mixing to ensure equilibration. The ozone treatment was administered on the fifth day following the addition of water to the barley samples.
2.6. Ozonation of barley grains
2.6.1. Effect of ozone concentration and exposure time
Barley grains (approx. 500 g) with an adjusted moisture content of 20%, were subjected to ozone treatments within the ozonation unit. Room temperature of 20 °C (±1 °C) and high relative humidity values (97.6%) were maintained by a potassium sulphate slurry. The investigation employed a full factorial design (5 × 4; no replicates), treating barley systematically with ozone concentrations of 0, 10, 30, 50, and 100 ppm for durations
