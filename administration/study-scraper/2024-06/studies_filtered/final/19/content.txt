Ozone oxidation leads to the substitution of hydroxyl groups in the starch molecules with carboxyl or carbonyl

groups, thereby increasing the degree of substitution. A thorough examination of how ozone treatment impacts

the composition of various cereal crops, including wheat, rice, and maize, is provided. This review explores the

repercussions of ozone on starch rheology, germination ability, and storage stability.The present review also

explores the textural qualities of food products such as bread, noodles, and cakes prepared with ozonized grains.

Ozone treatment is found to significantly reduce swelling capacity and solubility of natural starch, and differ
-

ential scanning calorimetry reveals that the gelatinization and retrogradation temperature profiles of oxidized

starches remain comparable to those of native starch. The evidence that ozone treatment holds substantial

promise for enhancing the functionality of starch in various applications while simultaneously upholding the

essential standards of food safety has also been explained in detail. The findings synthesized in this review shed

light on the intricate interplay between ozone and starch, providing valuable insights for both the scientific

community and the food industry.

Introduction

Ozone (O3) is a capable antioxidant that is Generally recognized as

safe (GRAS). Both in liquid and gaseous forms, ozone is frequently uti
-

lized in food safety applications as an antibacterial and disinfectant

agent. Ozone therapy has been shown to kill pathogens such asgram-

positive bacteria, viruses, gram-negative bacteria, fungi, fungal spores,

and protozoa.Numerous food products have been treated with ozone in

the past, including food grain products (such as wheat flour), fresh foods

(includingvegetables and fruits), beverages or liquid foods (including

apple and orange juice), and dairy products (such as milk, powdered

milk, and cheese). Tiwari et al. (2010) examined the uses of ozone

treatment in the processing of grains. In a nutshell, ozone has the po
-

tential to significantly reduce,such as storing insects
 Triboliumconfusum

in
 wheat
,
 Sitophilus
 zeamais
 and
 Triboliumcastaneum
 in
 maize.It
 is

possible to efficiently remove mycotoxins as well as the related fungus

such as
 Aspergillus parasiticus
 in the maize, aflatoxins in corn, and

deoxynivalenol in wheat. In addition to ensuring food safety, ozone may

alter some of the functional qualities of grain products. Ozone gas

treatment on wheat or cereal kernels decreased the energy needed for

grain milling while boosting the speed of germination. Additionally,

there has been published research on the use of ozone in food processing

(Obadi
 et
 al.,
 2018).
 In

vestigations into the effects of ozone on grain components protein and

starch content and characteristics (Savi et al., 2014 Goz
´
e et al., 2017).

Ozone is recognized for its potent oxidizing capabilities and is a good

antimicrobial
 agent,
 offering
 a

 substitute
 to
 conventional

methods of food preservation (Cullen et al., 2019). Its efficacy in quickly

neutralizing various microorganisms, including viruses, bacteria, molds,

and yeasts, has been demonstrated (Kim, 2012). This property has been

extensively tested on a wide range of food products during their pro
-

cessing and storage phases, confirming its role in enhancing product

shelf-life. Additionally, ozone treatment has been shown to effectively

reduce the Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) and Biological Oxygen

Demand (BOD) in wastewater generated from food processing washes

(Ledakowicz et al., 2017). The environmental benefits of ozone use are
