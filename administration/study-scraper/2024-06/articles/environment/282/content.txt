Here are the five paragraphs using the guidelines and information from the scientific study:

**Paragraph 1**
Climate change is a pressing global issue that has far-reaching consequences on human health. This systematic review aimed to examine the association between climate change-related environmental stressors and cardiovascular health outcomes. The study analyzed observational studies published from January 1, 1970, to November 15, 2023, which evaluated associations between environmental exposures and cardiovascular mortality, acute cardiovascular events, and related healthcare utilization.

**Paragraph 2**
The evidence review included a comprehensive search of four major databases: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library. The study identified 20,798 articles that were screened by two investigators for full-text review. Study quality was assessed using the Navigation Guide framework, which allows for the evaluation of the strength of evidence. A total of 2564 studies underwent full-text review, with 492 observational studies meeting the inclusion criteria.

**Paragraph 3**
The study found strong associations between climate change-related environmental stressors and cardiovascular health outcomes. Exposure to extreme temperature was linked to increased cardiovascular mortality and morbidity, while ground-level ozone amplified the risk associated with higher temperatures. Extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, were also associated with increased cardiovascular risk that persisted for many months after the initial event.

**Paragraph 4**
The study's findings highlight the disproportionate impact of climate change on vulnerable populations, including older adults, racial and ethnic minoritized groups, and lower-wealth communities. The authors emphasized the need to mitigate climate change-associated cardiovascular risk through urgent action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. They also noted that data on outcomes in low-income countries were lacking, underscoring the importance of further research in this area.

**Paragraph 5**
In conclusion, this systematic review underscores the critical relationship between climate change and cardiovascular health outcomes. The findings have significant implications for public health policy and healthcare practice, highlighting the need to address the environmental determinants of health. By acknowledging the disproportionate impact of climate change on vulnerable populations, we can work towards a more equitable and sustainable future.
