Here is a detailed summary of the study in one paragraph:

A new catalyst, Cu2S/Ni3S2@NF, was synthesized by a simple hydrothermal method and tested for catalytic ozonation of p-nitrophenol (PNP) in wastewater. The results showed that the catalyst achieved a removal rate of 99.9% in 40 minutes, which is significantly higher than other systems. Electron spin resonance (ESR) revealed that singlet oxygen and superoxide radicals were the primary active species for PNP degradation. The catalyst remained stable after being used five times, with no significant decrease in activity. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis confirmed the formation of Cu2S/Ni3S2 nanosheets on the nickel foam substrate. The study demonstrated that the synergistic effect between Ni3+/Ni2+ and Cu2+/Cu+ in the catalyst can enhance catalytic decomposition of ozone, making it an efficient and durable solution for removing PNP from wastewater.
