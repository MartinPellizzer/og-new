The results show that air quality is divided into two types: good and moderate, with different proportions each day. The C4.5 algorithm achieved a success rate of 99.5074% and a failure rate of 0.4926% when processing air quality data. It was effective in classifying air quality and processing data. This study demonstrates the potential of using machine learning algorithms like C4.5 to classify air quality data and provide accurate information to the public.
