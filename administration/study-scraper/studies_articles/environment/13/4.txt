In conclusion, this study highlights the importance of considering atmospheric pollution as a potential risk factor for preterm birth. The results provide evidence that reducing exposure to PM2.5, PM10, NO2, CO, and SO2 during mid-pregnancy may help reduce the risk of preterm birth. These findings have significant implications for public health policy and highlight the need for further research to better understand the relationship between atmospheric pollution and preterm birth.
