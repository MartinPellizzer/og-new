The study employed a lumped parameter model that accounted for the reduction of cerium (IV) ions to cerium (III) ions by steel components and the simultaneous oxidation of cerium (III) ions to cerium (IV) ions by ozone in a static mixer. The model was experimentally validated using a corrosion experiment at 5 L scale with non-radioactive AISI SS304L stainless steel components of different geometries. The parameters studied included gas flow rate, liquid flow rate, ozone concentration, initial nitric acid concentration, and volume of solution.
