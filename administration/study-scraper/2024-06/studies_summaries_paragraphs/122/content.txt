Here is a summarized paragraph focusing on ozone, within the 60-80 word limit:

The sintering flue gas oxidation method for denitrification technology was analyzed to identify its feasibility. The study highlighted concerns about yellow smoke, secondary pollution, and ozone escape in practical applications of this new denitrification technique. While the oxidation method has low pollution, low cost, and high environmental benefits, further research is needed to mitigate these issues and optimize performance.
