In conclusion, this study demonstrates the potential of machine learning methods for improving ozone pollution control in urban areas by decoupling meteorological factors. The findings provide valuable recommendations for implementing effective emission reduction measures and evaluating their effectiveness in different meteorological conditions. Further research is needed to generalize these results to other urban areas and explore the application of similar methods to other air pollutants.
