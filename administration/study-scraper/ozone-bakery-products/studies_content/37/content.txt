Abstract
Considering the wide existence of mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON) in wheat and derived products, finding ways to detoxify DON in wheat grains as original resources for food-chain contamination is very important to protect human health and reduce economic losses. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of destroying DON in wheat via ozonation under different conditions, such as moisture content (MC), ozone concentration, exposure time, and form of raw-material. The achieved data showed that DON reduction significantly improved with increased ozone concentration and exposure time. The whole wheat flour (WWF) was easier to degrade than the wheat kernels. Higher MC decreased larger amounts of DON. The maximum reduction of DON was 20.10% for the MC group, compared with the 11.79% and 16.29% for the other MC groups. DON concentration decreased from 3.89 mg/kg to 0.83 mg/kg under the generally recognized Maximum Residue Limit (MRL) level of 1 mg/kg, when WWF was treated with 100 mg/L of ozone treatment for 60 min. The first-order kinetic model established in this work showed a good R-squared value (R2 > 0.877) and was consistent with the results. Therefore, ozonation is an effective and rapid way to degrade DON in wheat, especially in whole wheat flour.
Introduction
Deoxynivalenol (DON), a second metabolite produced by Fusarium, especially by Fusarium graminearum, is a major plant pathogen that can lead to Fusariun Head Blight (FHB) in wheat and Gibberella ear rot in maize. DON is associated with FHB, while a direct relationship between DON and Gibberella ear rot has been established (Karami-Osboo et al., 2013, Savi et al., 2014). DON can inhibit the synthesis of proteins when humans or animals ingest food contaminated by DON, causing immune dysregulation, reproductive and teratogenic effects, carcinogenesis, and aberrant intercellular signaling (Dall'Asta et al., 2004, Pestka, 2010a, Pestka, 2010b).
As a major cereal crop in the world (Jajić, Krstović, Kos, & Abramović, 2014), wheat is susceptible to DON, annually causing significant economic loss in China and other parts of the world. FAO/WHO (2001) showed that 57% of 11,444 tested wheat samples were contaminated by DON. Moreover, according to a survey on contamination of DON in Henan and Anhui provinces in China, the detection rate of DON in wheat and corn was 76.7%; here, the average DON concentration detected was 424 μg/kg and the maximum concentration detected was 3737 μg/kg. Other provinces registered a 60% detection rate, with an average DON concentration of 52.5 μg/kg (Xiong, Hu, Wang, Wei, & Cheng, 2009).
Contamination of DON in grains is difficult to avoid because of climate and environment conditions. The wide and serious spread of DON has attracted increased attention and served as an impetus for finding an effective method to control further contamination. However, DON is stable enough to protect itself from destruction. Several studies have reported physical, chemical, and biological methods to destroy DON (Li et al., 2011, Pei et al., 2005, Vidal et al., 2014, Vidal et al., 2014, Young et al., 1986, Yu et al., 2010). DON is insensitive to temperature, and thus, cannot be degraded even at a heating temperature of 120 °C. Other studies have proven that common food processing, such as bread baking and high temperature, pressure, and extrusion cooking (Bullerman and Bianchini, 2007, Cazzaniga et al., 2001), have certain effects on DON degradation. However, these treatments are time consuming, rigorous, and even result in nutrition loss and quality reduction. Alkaline treatment and oxidation methods, using ammonium, hydrogen peroxide hydroxide, and hypochlorite, are common chemical methods.
Ozone gas is a strong oxidizing reagent that can destroy the double bond in organics, and further produce simple products with less double bond and low molecular weight (Bailey, 1958). In addition, ozone has favorable penetration, and can decompose to oxygen voluntarily with no toxic residual (Brooks and Csallany, 1978, McKenzie et al., 1997). Ozone has been identified as Generally Recognized As Safe by the United States in 1997, and can be directly applied to food by the Food and Drug Administration (Guzel-Seydim et al., 2004, USDA, 1997). In China, ozone can be used as a disinfectant for drinking water at acceptable levels of up to 0.3 mg/L (GB 5479-2006). In addition, previous studies have proven that ozone can detoxify mycotoxins, especially aflatoxins (AFs), effectively in food, such as peanuts (Chen et al., 2014, Diao et al., 2013, Proctor et al., 2004), corn (Luo et al., 2014; Prudente Jr & King, 2002), and wheat (Li et al., 2013, Raila et al., 2006). The most reduction of AFs reached up to 91.32%. Ozonation decreases the content of AFs, which broke up into different products with less toxicity and mutagenic activities (Luo et al., 2013, Maeba et al., 1988). Nevertheless, compared with the sufficient studies on AFs, those about treating DON by ozone are relatively less (Savi et al., 2014, Young et al., 1986, Young et al., 2006). DON in contaminated corn can be reduced by 90% within 1 h by moist ozone (Young, 1986). Li, Guan, and Bian (2015) also obtained a 57.3% reduction in DON by ozonation, with the MC of 17% in wheat. These results suggest that ozone use is a feasible method to detoxify the toxin.
Based on the effect of ozone on some mycotoxins, earlier studies have indicated the effects of detoxifying DON by ozone. Although limited research results and relatively simple treatment process could be deduced, further research is necessary. To advance the research, the current study aims to i) evaluate the effect of ozone on DON in wheat under different conditions and ii) build a model for predicting the degradation rate of DON to provide guides for practical application.

Materials
Naturally contaminated wheat (Wanmai 50) was obtained from a local market (Suzhou, Anhui province, China) and stored at −20 °C. DON standard was purchased from J&K Scientific Ltd. (Shanghai, China). High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) grade acetonitrile (ACN) and methanol (MeOH) were supplied by Fisher Scientific (CA, USA). Ultrapure water (resistivity ≥ 18 MΩ/cm) was obtained from a Millipore-Q SP Reagent Water system (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA) and pre-filtered through a 0.22 μm
Effect of MC on DON in wheat
The primary DON content in wheat with 11.79%, 16.29%, and 20.10% MC was 3.98, 3.93, and 3.89 mg/kg, respectively. MC in wheat was critical for DON degradation (Fig. 1A and B). Less reaction between ozone and WWF occurred when MC was 11.79% (Fig. 1A), DON concentration decreased to 2.09 mg/kg when the 100 mg/L ozone treatment lasted for 60 min. While MC increased to 20.10%, DON concentration was reduced to 0.83 mg/kg sharply, which was lower than the generally recognized Maximum Residue Limit
Conclusion
Ozonation is an effective method to detoxify DON in wheat. Degradation rate improves significantly with the increase in ozone concentration and exposure time. MC is a vital factor that affects the DON level in samples during ozonation. MC has a positive correlation with the degradation rate of DON; the degradation rate of 20.10% MC wheat is higher than that of 16.29% and 11.79% MC wheat. At an ozone concentration of 100 mg/L and treatment duration of 60 min, DON concentration decreases to

Deoxynivalenol (DON) is a monoterpene compound with stable physicochemical properties, which widely exists in grains, such as wheat, rice and corn (Li, Sun, Hong, Duan, & Du, 2019; Palacios et al., 2017). DON is difficult to be damaged during processing, and has become an important potential risk in the process of grain production and processing (Wang et al., 2016). It can cause extensive toxic effects in humans and animals after accidental ingestion of food contaminated with DON (Gerez, Desto, & Bracarense, 2017; Wang et al., 2021).

Reduced of mycotoxin levels in parboiled rice by using ozone and its effects on technological and chemical properties

Citation Excerpt :
Decreases in the dark color of parboiled grains treated with ozone can be justified by its oxidizing effect, which promotes the degradation of pigments such as polyphenols, carotenoids, and Maillard products, before they diffusing to the endosperm (Zhu, 2018). Studies carried out by Chittrakorn et al. (2014), Wang et al. (2016) and Sui et al. (2016) corroborate with the results found in the present study, emphasizing ozone as a high potential bleaching agent due to the great pigment degradation capacity. The percentages of blackened and stained grains obtained for conventional parboiled rice and ozone-treated parboiled rice are shown in Fig. 2.
