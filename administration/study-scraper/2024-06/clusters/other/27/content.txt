Abstract: Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs) have demonstrated being one of the most efficient processes for micropollutants abatement from water and soil systems. Although these processes have been implemented at full scale, fundamentally ozone and UV radiation, it is needed to reduce the energy consumption linked to ozone production and light sources to ensure the economic viability of technologies. The aim of this thesis is the development and optimization of an innovative technology based on advanced oxidation systems that employ nanoparticles for the removal of micropollutants in wastewater. In this regard, several reactor con igurations and operational conditions have been studied under different types of light sources.
