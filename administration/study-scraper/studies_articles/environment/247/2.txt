The experimental results show that the STD-GCN outperformed LSTM and GC-LSTM, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting O3 concentration. By integrating wind field factors, the STD-GCN exhibited better spatial interpretability. The model's performance was evaluated using metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE). The results suggest that the STD-GCN is a promising approach for predicting O3 concentration in the PRD region.
