Three candidate sRNAs (sRNA18, sRNA36, and sRNA79) showed the most promising characteristics for involvement in denitrification. Overexpression of sRNA36 was found to impact the rate of N2O reduction, and experimental confirmation of FNR regulation was achieved. This suggests that sRNAs controlled by FNR transcriptional regulators may play a key role in regulating denitrification.
