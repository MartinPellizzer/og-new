A comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, and ProQuest databases from inception to December 21, 2022. Studies evaluating ozone therapy as an adjunct treatment for DFUs were included if they reported quantitative data on wound size change, time to complete ulcer healing, adverse events, amputation rates, and hospital length of stay. A random-effects model was used for meta-analysis, and interstudy heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 index and Cochrane Q statistic test.
