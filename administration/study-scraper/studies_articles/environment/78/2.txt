The results show that road transport is the significant contributor to primary species such as NOx, PM2.5, CO, and BC emissions in Cyprus. The concentrations of most pollutants are below the corresponding limit values established in Cypriot and European legislation. However, the target value for ozone is exceeded, and the limit value for suspended particles with a diameter of less than 10 micrometers (PM10) is also exceeded. The study reveals an increasing trend in ozone accompanied by a decreasing trend in nitrogen oxides.
