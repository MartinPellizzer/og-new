Abstract
     The Non-thermal plasma has a wide range of applications in different areas. In this study, the oxidation of a model fuel containing organo-sulfur compounds (benzothiophene and dibenzothiophene) was investigated using plasma. The process involved ozone generation through dielectric barrier discharge, followed by extraction using acetonitrile. The results demonstrated the efficient oxidation and removal of dibenzothiophene and benzothiophene by non-thermal plasma. The desulfurization efficiency reached 93.78% under the optimum conditions, including a voltage of 11Kv, temperature of 50ºC, duration of 4 hours, and a flow rate of 75 ml/min.
