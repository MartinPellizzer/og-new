The study found that industrial areas and high-traffic density zones are major sources of pollutants, including particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, and volatile organic compounds. On the other hand, green spaces and low-density residential developments are associated with improved air quality and act as natural buffers against pollution. The results also showed that the pattern of urban land use affects the spatial distribution of air pollution, with industrial areas in the south of the region (Region 21) contributing the most to air pollution due to the accumulation of industrial and workshop uses.
