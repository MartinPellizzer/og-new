In conclusion, this study demonstrates the potential of UV-O3 exposure as a tool for tailoring the optical and electrical properties of suspended and flat 2D TMDCs. The results highlight the importance of defects in shaping the properties of these materials and provide valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying their behavior. Future research directions include exploring the application of UV-O3 exposure to other TMDC-based systems and investigating the potential for defect engineering in TMDCs.
