Here is a detailed summary of the study in 1 paragraph:

This study investigates the cultivation of duckweed in controlled environments using vertical towers to maximize biomass production. Abiotic and biotic parameters were tested and standardized to optimize growth conditions for various duckweed varieties. The effects of aqueous ozone treatment on bacterial community diversity were also examined, comparing two DPM systems with and without disinfection using re-circulating aqueous ozone. Results showed that duckweed can be cultivated long-term and harvest yield increased using a vertical multi-layered platform under controlled conditions when management protocols are followed. Additionally, the study found that aqueous ozonation significantly altered the prevalence and relative abundance of bacterial taxa associated with duckweed tissue, demonstrating its effectiveness in reducing total bacterial load.
