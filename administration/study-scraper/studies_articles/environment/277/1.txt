This multicountry two-stage time series analysis used data from the Multi-City Multi-Country (MCC) Collaborative Research Network, which collected daily all-cause, cardiovascular, and respiratory deaths from 749 locations in 43 countries or areas between 2000 and 2016. The study estimated population-weighted exposure to wildfire-related O3 using a chemical transport model, validated with ground monitoring data. A three-step approach was used to adjust and downscale the wildfire-related O3 concentration to a spatial resolution of 0·25° × 0·25°. Quasi-Poisson regression models were fitted to examine the relationships between short-term exposure to wildfire-related O3 and daily mortality, with consideration of potential lag effects.
