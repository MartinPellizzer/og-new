**Paragraph 1: Introduction**

This study examines the variations of chloride depletion and its impacts on ozone formation in a coastal area in Shanghai. Chloride plays a crucial role in atmospheric chemistry, and marine chloride depletion is a significant source of atmospheric chlorine. The study aims to investigate the relationships between chloride depletion and various factors, including meteorological conditions, ship emissions, and sea-salt aerosols.

**Paragraph 2: Methods**

The researchers used continuous monitoring data from the Chongming Dongtan supersite in Shanghai from 2019 to 2022. They analyzed the water soluble ions, criteria pollutants, and meteorological data using the Concentration Weighted Trajectory (CWT) method to identify the main source regions contributing to chloride depletion. Additionally, they employed the community atmospheric chemistry box model Chemistry As A Box model Application/Module Efﬁciently Calculating the Chemistry of the Atmosphere (CAABA/MECCA) to analyze the impact of chloride depletion on ozone formation.

**Paragraph 3: Results**

The study found that chloride depletion increases in summer and decreases in winter, with peak values around noon. The CWT analysis revealed that airflows predominantly originate from the ocean during periods of chloride depletion. Modeling results showed that oceanic chlorine depletion contributes approximately 8 ppb to the enhancement of O3 concentrations.

**Paragraph 4: Discussion**

The study's findings highlight the significance of considering chloride depletion in coastal areas, particularly those with heavy shipping activities. The inverse trend between chloride depletion and NO2, N2O5, NO3·, and pH suggests that chloride depletion is closely related to atmospheric oxidizing capacity and global climate. The study also demonstrates the importance of ship emissions through chloride depletion mechanisms in contributing to O3 pollution.

**Paragraph 5: Conclusions**

In conclusion, this study provides valuable insights into the variations of chloride depletion and its impacts on ozone formation in a coastal area in Shanghai. The findings underscore the need to consider the complex interactions between chloride depletion, meteorological conditions, and ship emissions in atmospheric chemistry modeling and air quality management strategies. Future research should focus on further exploring these relationships and developing effective mitigation measures to reduce the negative impacts of chloride depletion on coastal ecosystems.
