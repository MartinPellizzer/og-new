The results showed that the rate constant for the O3/PMS process was approximately 14.4 times higher than that for the process employing ozone only. The highest degradation efficiencies were achieved at pH 7.0 (1.80 × 10-2 min-1) and 40°C (2.18 × 10-2 min-1). Alkalinity and humic acid significantly reduced the degradation of TMAH. Remarkably, removal efficiencies of 64.4% for TMAH and 43.7% for total organic carbon (TOC) were achieved at a relatively high initial concentration.
