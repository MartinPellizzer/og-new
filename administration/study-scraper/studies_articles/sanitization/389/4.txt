In conclusion, this study has proposed optimal parameters for ozone production and supply in an ozone-containing mixture for hyperbaric oxygenation in confined spaces without harming patient or medical staff health. The use of ozone therapy as a treatment option for infectious and purulent complications is supported by the study's findings, which highlight its potential benefits in promoting healing and reducing infection.
