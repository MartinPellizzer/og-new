In conclusion, this study demonstrates the potential of the STD-GCN model in predicting O3 concentration in the PRD region. The results show that the model outperforms traditional machine learning algorithms and provides better spatial interpretability by incorporating wind field factors. This study contributes to the development of more effective ozone prediction models, which are essential for mitigating air pollution in urban areas. Future research should continue to refine and adapt this approach for real-world applications.
