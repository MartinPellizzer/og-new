Life cycle environmental assessment is a crucial aspect of evaluating the sustainability of various systems. The installation of renewable energy systems is becoming increasingly important to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and mitigate climate change. However, the ecological impact of these systems is often overlooked. A recent study by Islam et al. (2024) aimed to assess the life cycle environmental effects of a hybrid renewable energy system installed in Doomadgee, Far North Queensland.
