The findings of this study have significant implications for the optimization of ozone-based wastewater treatment processes. The proposed model provides a simplified framework for understanding the complex mechanisms underlying ozone decomposition, allowing for more effective process control and optimization. Additionally, the results highlight the importance of considering the matrix-dependent decomposition patterns in wastewater effluents when designing and operating ozonation systems.
