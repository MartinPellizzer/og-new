The results showed that the mass transfer rate of O2 and/or O3 determined the reaction rate in the main stage of the oxidation process. The presence of ozone significantly improved the oxidation ratio of industrial zinc sulfite. The average enhancement of the oxidation rate was 15% when ozone was added to the system. Furthermore, ozone caused organic matter attached to industrial zinc sulfite particles to fall off into the solution, which also improved the oxidation efficiency.
