Here is a summary of the study in 1 detailed paragraph:

UV-ozone (UV-O3) exposure was investigated as a method to tailor the optical and electrical properties of suspended and flat 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs). The study found that UV-O3 exposure significantly alters the defect structure and properties of TMDCs, with changes in the optical absorption spectra and electrical conductivity. The researchers used focused ion beam (FIB) to create defects and then exposed the samples to UV-O3, resulting in a reduction of defect density and an increase in carrier mobility. The results demonstrate that UV-O3 exposure can be used to engineer defects in TMDCs, enabling control over their optical and electronic properties.
