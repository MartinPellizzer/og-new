Here is a summary of the study in one detailed paragraph, focusing on the information and data related to ozone:

This study aimed to develop an innovative technology for micropollutant removal from wastewater using advanced oxidation systems with nanoparticles. Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs), which often employ ozone and UV radiation, have been effective but energy-intensive, hindering their economic viability. To address this, the researchers explored reactor configurations and operational conditions under different light sources to optimize ozone production while reducing energy consumption.
