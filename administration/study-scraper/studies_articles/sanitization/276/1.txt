The study used a water supply column to investigate the saturation of ozone in tap water and the kinetics of ozone destruction. The authors generated ozone using an ozonator with a flow rate of 13.2 L/min and an ozone concentration of 2.7 g/m3. They determined the ozone concentration in the water by following the standard procedure.
