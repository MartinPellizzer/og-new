The methods used to calculate the carbon footprint of inhalers involve several factors, including methodology, type of inhaler, and type of propellant. The data used in these calculations are often estimated, incomplete, or not independently certified, which raises concerns about the accuracy of the results. Furthermore, the environmental impact of inhalers includes more than just carbon emissions; other impacts include fossil and metal depletion, ozone depletion, and ocean acidification.
