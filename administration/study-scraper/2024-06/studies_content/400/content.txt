Key Points
Question  Are long-term exposures to air pollution from different emission sources associated with loss of independence in later life?
Findings  In this cohort study of 25 314 adults older than 50 years, higher residential levels of traffic-related air pollutants, including particulate matter less than 2.5 μm in diameter (PM2.5) from road traffic, PM2.5 from nonroad traffic, and nitrogen dioxide, were associated with greater risks of lost independence.
Meaning  These findings suggest that traffic-related air pollution may be associated with the likelihood of needing help for lost independence among older adults and that interventions to reduce pollution exposure may be associated with a prolonged ability to live independently.
Abstract
Importance  Air pollution is a recognized risk factor associated with chronic diseases, including respiratory and cardiovascular conditions, which can lead to physical and cognitive impairments in later life. Although these losses of function, individually or in combination, reduce individuals’ likelihood of living independently, little is known about the association of air pollution with this critical outcome.
Objective  To investigate associations between air pollution and loss of independence in later life.
Design, Setting, and Participants  This cohort study was conducted as part of the Environmental Predictors Of Cognitive Health and Aging study and used 1998 to 2016 data from the Health and Retirement Study. Participants included respondents from this nationally representative, population-based cohort who were older than 50 years and had not previously reported a loss of independence. Analyses were performed from August 31 to October 15, 2023.
Exposures  Mean 10-year pollutant concentrations (particulate matter less than 2.5 μm in diameter [PM2.5] or ranging from 2.5 μm to 10 μm in diameter [PM10-2.5], nitrogen dioxide [NO2], and ozone [O3]) were estimated at respondent addresses using spatiotemporal models along with PM2.5 levels from 9 emission sources.
Main Outcomes and Measures  Loss of independence was defined as newly receiving care for at least 1 activity of daily living or instrumental activity of daily living due to health and memory problems or moving to a nursing home. Associations were estimated with generalized estimating equation regression adjusting for potential confounders.
Results  Among 25 314 respondents older than 50 years (mean [SD] baseline age, 61.1 [9.4] years; 11 208 male [44.3%]), 9985 individuals (39.4%) experienced lost independence during a mean (SD) follow-up of 10.2 (5.5) years. Higher exposure levels of mean concentration were associated with increased risks of lost independence for total PM2.5 levels (risk ratio [RR] per 1-IQR of 10-year mean, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.01-1.10), PM2.5 levels from road traffic (RR per 1-IQR of 10-year mean, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.03-1.16) and nonroad traffic (RR per 1-IQR of 10-year mean, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.03-1.24), and NO2 levels (RR per 1-IQR of 10-year mean, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.01-1.08). Compared with other sources, traffic-generated pollutants were most consistently and robustly associated with loss of independence; only road traffic-related PM2.5 levels remained associated with increased risk after adjustment for PM2.5 from other sources (RR per 1-IQR increase in 10-year mean concentration, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.00-1.21). Other pollutant-outcome associations were null, except for O3 levels, which were associated with lower risks of lost independence (RR per 1-IQR increase in 10-year mean concentration, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.92-0.97).
Conclusions and Relevance  This study found that long-term exposure to air pollution was associated with the need for help for lost independence in later life, with especially large and consistent increases in risk for pollution generated by traffic-related sources. These findings suggest that controlling air pollution could be associated with diversion or delay of the need for care and prolonged ability to live independently.
Introduction
Functional decline is common in aging populations, arising from subclinical pathologies and chronic diseases across multiple organs.1-3 As functional limitations due to health or memory problems increase in severity, affected individuals can experience substantial difficulties in their ability to live independently without help. Loss in independence is important given that it often results in large emotional and economic burdens for older adults, their families, and society.4-6 Nearly 30% of Medicare enrollees in the US receive help due to health problems with mobility, routine household activities, or basic self-care activities.7 Given the large and growing older adult population, interventions to prevent or delay the need for help due to lost independence are becoming increasingly important.
Air pollutants have well-established relationships with chronic health conditions, including cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), respiratory diseases, and diabetes, as well as the pathophysiological processes that give rise to these conditions.8-11 Chronic disease often leads to impairments in physical and cognitive function through mechanisms such as increased pain, reduced lung function, poor circulation, and disturbed sleep that can reduce physical endurance and mental acuity.12-14 Because functional limitations lead to lost independence, it is plausible that air pollution contributes to loss of independence; however, this has not been well-studied. Additionally, the loss of independence may better reflect the cumulative burden of air pollution in later life across multiple clinical and subclinical outcomes.
In this study, we leveraged a nationally representative cohort study to investigate associations of long-term concentrations of particulate matter air pollution (particulate matter less than 2.5 μm in diameter [PM2.5] or ranging from 2.5 μm to 10 μm in diameter [PM10-2.5]), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and ozone (O3) using estimates from a state-of-art spatiotemporal model with loss of independence.15-17 We focused on these pollutants because they are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Given that different sources, such as agriculture, traffic, power generation, windblown dust, and wildfires, emit PM2.5 with distinct physical and chemical characteristics, we also evaluated PM2.5 levels from key emission sources.
Methods
Study Population
This cohort study used data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), a nationally representative sample of people older than 50 years in the US. HRS and our use of linkages of HRS residential addresses to environmental measures through the Environmental Predictors of Cognitive Health and Aging (EPOCH) study were approved by the University of Michigan institutional review board. Informed consent was obtained from all respondents, and we followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guideline.
HRS began recruiting in 1992 and added new birth cohorts every 6 years,18 with interviews biennially. For respondents who died or those unable or unwilling to be interviewed, the study surveyed a spouse, child, or another proxy.19
We studied all respondents with at least 2 interviews between 1998 and 2016, when our air pollution estimates were available. To assess the incidence, we included only respondents who had not previously reported receiving help with activities of daily living (ADL) or instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) or living in a nursing home at baseline. We also excluded respondents with missing data on pollution, independence, or confounders (eFigure 1 in Supplement 1).
Identification of Incident Loss of Independence
We assessed new loss of independence at each interview for living respondents and in the last 3 months of life for respondents who had died. We classified loss of independence as newly receiving help in any ADL (ie, walking across the room, dressing, bathing or showering, eating, getting in or out of bed, and using the toilet) or IADL (ie, using the telephone, managing money, taking medications, grocery shopping, and preparing home meals) due to health or memory problems or moving to a nursing home.
In secondary analyses, we evaluated 2 mutually exclusive subcategories for lost independence: receiving assistance with at least 1 ADL item and receiving assistance solely with IADL or receiving no assistance but moving into a nursing home. We assumed that these 2 subtypes represented transitions from living independently to lost independence and receiving personal care.
Air Pollution Assessment
We used spatiotemporal models to estimate PM2.5, PM10-2.5, NO2, and O3 concentrations at all respondent residential addresses from 1990 to 201620,21 to assess mean exposures in the 10 years prior to each survey. These models incorporated regulatory monitor and research study network data, more than 300 geographic covariates, and spatial and temporal correlations to estimate mean concentrations at a 2-week resolution from 1999 to 2016 and an annual resolution from 1990 to 1999, when monitoring data for PM2.5 levels were more limited.20,22 With our interest in long-term exposures, we used year-round O3 level estimates instead of those for the warm season only. The cross-validation R2 for these models in most regions is greater than 0.80.20,23
We estimated source-specific concentrations of PM2.5 from agriculture, road traffic, nonroad traffic, energy from coal combustion, other energy, industry from coal combustion, other industry, wildfires, and windblown dust (eAppendix 1 in Supplement 1) by multiplying the total PM2.5 concentration at each residence by spatially resolved, fractional source-specific contributions of PM2.5.24 Briefly, these fractions were generated at a resolution of 0.5° × 0.625° from zero-out simulations in an atmospheric chemistry transport model (GEOS-Chem version 12.1.0).24 Although these models used 2017 emission data, we assumed that estimates reflected source contributions over the past decade given that 2017 emissions in the EPA National Emissions Inventory were strongly correlated with mean emissions from 2007 to 2017 for most sources (eFigure 2 in Supplement 1). We a priori focused on sources believed to have the most reliable emission information, as well as wildfires based on their increasing importance.
Covariates
Detailed information about respondent demographic characteristics and health was collected during each follow-up interview. This included age, sex, self-reported race and ethnicity (Hispanic, non-Hispanic Black, non-Hispanic White, and non-Hispanic other [eg, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, and Pacific Islander]), marital status (married/partnered or unmarried/unpartnered), number of children (0, 1, 2, 3, or ≥4 children), educational attainment (<high school, General Educational Development test, high school, some college, ≥college), ownership of a primary residence, total household wealth, urbanicity (urban, suburban, or rural), and neighborhood social economic status (NSES) level. Race and ethnicity were assessed because there are known differences in the outcomes by race and ethnicity and systemic disinvestment in communities have resulted in differential pollution exposure by these same characteristics. We defined NSES using 11 US Census variables, including population income, housing, and occupation.25 Chronic diseases were self-reported at each interview, including diagnosis of CVDs (heart problems, stroke, or transient ischemic attack), chronic lung diseases except asthma, and diabetes. We also assessed the maximum normalized difference vegetation index near respondent homes (250 m and 1000 m buffers) for the year of the interview as a measure of green space. Annual mean temperatures were estimated for each respondent using state-level data from the Comparative Climactic Data center.
Statistical Analysis
We used generalized estimating equation Poisson regression to examine the association of 10-year mean air pollution levels with loss of independence26 while accounting for person-level sampling weights, geographic strata, and sampling clusters. Our primary analysis estimated risk ratios (RRs) for loss of independence per 1-IQR increase in concentration of each pollutant from single-pollutant models. Then, in 2-pollutant models for PM10-2.5, NO2, and O3 levels, we additionally adjusted for total PM2.5 levels. Whereas 2-pollution models focused on source-specific PM2.5 levels, we included the sum of PM2.5 levels from all other sources. Lastly, we included all other pollutants (ie, PM10-2.5, NO2, and O3) in multipollutant models. We modeled source-specific PM2.5 levels as main effects instead of using the fractional source contributions as an effect modifier to allow for residential moves over time.
In all models, we adjusted for potential confounders, including baseline age, birth year, calendar date of interview, sex, race and ethnicity, marital status, number of children, educational attainment, ownership of primary residence at baseline, total household wealth at baseline fitted by natural splines with 5 degrees of freedom to account for potential nonlinearity, urbanicity, and NSES at each interview. We included multiple time-related variables because air pollution concentrations follow secular trends, age is a factor associated with high risk of loss of independence, and HRS recruited from a wide range of birth cohorts. Similarly, because SES is an important cofounder between air pollution and health outcomes, we adjusted for individual and neighborhood-level SES in our models. We also included an unpenalized thin-place regression spline with 10 degrees of freedom to flexibly adjust for residual spatial confounding.27,28
In secondary analyses, we estimated RRs per 1-μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 level. We also examined effect modification by baseline age category (≥75 or <75 years) and prevalent chronic disease (ie, CVD, chronic lung disease, or diabetes) on the multiplicative scale using interaction terms. To further explore mediation by chronic diseases, we adjusted for each disease in our models and observed changes in RRs. To learn more about potential mechanisms underlying these associations, we also explored associations with help required for ADL and IADL disability separately.
Using our observed RRs, we estimated the burden of incident loss of independence for the US population in 2015 attributable to any air pollutant robustly associated with a loss of independence following the Global Burden of Disease comparative risk assessment framework.29 We also evaluated the monetary cost associated with lost independence by estimating yearly costs per person for formal, informal, and nursing home care due to help for loss of independence, as described by Hurd et al30 and then multiplying our estimate of new individuals experiencing loss of independence from air pollution (eAppendix 2 in Supplement 1).
We performed several sensitivity analyses to evaluate the robustness of our findings. We tested for nonlinearity of our associations, used alternative mean exposure periods (1 years and 5 years), examined moving to nursing homes as an alternative outcome, and estimated hazard rate ratios using a Cox model. Because wildfires are temporally varying (eFigure 2 in Supplement 1), we also performed analyses using satellite-based estimates of wildfire-related PM2.5 levels from 2006 to 2017.31,32 Given that increased air temperatures promote the photochemical reaction of O3 and local vegetation is correlated with O3 levels,33,34 we adjusted our O3 models for green space and temperature. Finally, because individuals who need help may not receive it owing to social isolation, we restricted our analyses to participants who were married or partnered or had at least 1 child. We performed our data analyses from August 31 to October 15, 2023, in R statistical software version 4.2.1 (R Project for Statistical Computing) and SAS statistical software version 9.4 (SAS Institute). We determined statistical significance based on a P < .05 in a 2-sided test.
Results
Our study included 25 314 participants (mean [SD] age, 61.1 [9.4] years at baseline; 11 208 male [44.3%]; 2741 Hispanic [10.8%], 4196 non-Hispanic Black [16.6%], and 17 675 non-Hispanic White [69.8%]). Nearly 40% of respondents (9985 individuals [39.4%]) experienced a new loss of independence during our mean (SD) 10.2 (5.5) years of follow-up (Table). Compared with participants who remained independent, respondents who lost their independence were more likely to be White and have lower levels of formal education, had a lower mean level of wealth, were more likely to have chronic diseases at baseline, and had been exposed to higher median levels of most pollutants.
The median (IQR) 10-year mean PM2.5 level was 11.2 (9.5-13.3) μg/m3 with the largest contributions from road traffic, agriculture, noncoal industry, and wildfires (Table). Total levels of PM2.5, PM2.5 from agriculture, traffic, and energy production all were higher in the Midwest and lower in the West (Figure 1; eFigure 3 in Supplement 1). In contrast, O3 and PM2.5 levels from industry, wildfires, and dust were higher in the West. There were shared spatial patterns, with relatively high correlations among PM2.5 levels from agriculture, traffic, and coal-related energy (eTable 1 in Supplement 1). For total PM2.5 levels, there was also a moderate positive correlation with NO2 and a negative correlation with O3 levels.
Association of Air Pollution With Loss of Independence
In single-pollutant models, we observed that a 1-IQR higher 10-year mean concentration of PM2.5 was associated with increased risk of loss of independence (RR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.01-1.10) (eFigure 4 in Supplement 1). RRs per 1-IQR increase in 10-year mean concentrations in 9 source-specific PM2.5 ranged from 0.98 (95% CI, 0.96-1.01) for wildfires, which had no significant association, to the largest RRs, which were observed for road traffic–related (RR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.03-1.16) and nonroad traffic–related (RR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.03-1.24) PM2.5 levels. Notably, only road traffic–related PM2.5 levels remained robust to adjustment for PM2.5 from other sources in the 2-pollutant models and co-pollutants, with an RR of 1.10 (95% CI, 1.00-1.21) per 1-IQR increase in 10-year mean concentration in multipollutant models (Figure 2). The association with road traffic–related PM2.5 was similar to a difference in risk for a 2-year increase in age.
Among other pollutants (eFigure 4 in Supplement 1), NO2 levels were positively associated with an increased risk of loss of independence (RR per 1-IQR increase in 10-year mean concentration, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.01-1.08) in the single-pollutant model, which changed little with adjustment for total PM2.5 levels but became null in the multipollutant model (RR per 1-IQR increase in 10-year mean concentration, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.95-1.06) (Figure 2). In contrast, O3 levels per 1-IQR increase in 10-year mean concentration were observed to be robustly associated with lower risk of loss of independence (RR per 1-IQR increase in 10-year mean concentration, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.92-0.97) in the single-pollutant model. There were no associations for PM10-2.5 levels.
In secondary analyses, we found that the main contribution for all observed associations was the need for ADL help (eFigure 5 in Supplement 1; Figure 3). Higher levels of PM2.5 from road traffic, nonroad traffic, and NO2 were robustly associated with higher risks of ADL help, and higher levels of O3 were associated with lower risks of ADL help. No associations were found with help involving only IADL. Most RRs were generally higher among participants younger than 75 years at baseline (eTable 2 in Supplement 1) and participants with prevalent CVD or diabetes but not chronic lung disease (eTable 3 in Supplement 1). RRs were not reduced after adjustment for CVD, chronic lung diseases, or diabetes (eTable 4 in Supplement 1). Given that robust associations with loss of independence were found only for PM2.5 levels from road and nonroad traffic, we focused our burden calculations on these sources, estimating that nearly 729 727 new cases per year of loss of independence may have been attributable to traffic-related PM2.5 levels in the US, assuming our associations are unbiased. Given that the yearly cost to receive help for lost independence was $16 028 per person, we estimated that the total cost of individuals newly losing independence due to exposure to traffic-related air pollution was $11.7 billion per year.
Our primary findings remained relatively robust in sensitivity analyses. For example, associations for most air pollutants were approximately linear, with only the suggestion of lower RRs at higher concentrations for total PM2.5, PM2.5 from industry coal, and NO2 (eFigure 6 in Supplement 1). Our primary findings were robust to using different exposure windows (eFigure 7 in Supplement 1), fitting with a Cox model (eTable 5 in Supplement 1), restriction to individuals not socially isolated (eTable 6 in Supplement 1), additional adjustment for green space or temperature (eTable 7 in Supplement 1), the use of time-varying wildfire-related PM2.5 levels (eTable 8 in Supplement 1), and investigation of moving to nursing homes (eTable 9 in Supplement 1).
Discussion
In this national cohort study, we found higher risks of loss of independence due to health or memory problems among older adults who experienced higher long-term concentrations of air pollutants. Notably, there were differences across air pollutant types and emission sources, with the highest RRs and most robust associations after adjustment for PM2.5 levels from road and nonroad traffic. In contrast, lower O3 concentrations were associated with higher risks of loss of independence. Receiving help for ADL was the main contributor to all associations, reflecting more severe declines in physical and cognitive function. We found no evidence of mediation, but RRs in the association of air pollution with loss of independence were higher in individuals with chronic diseases, including CVD and diabetes.
This study contributes to the literature by newly evaluating associations between long-term exposure to air pollution and help for health or memory problems at older ages, which may be associated with physical or cognitive functional losses due to air pollution’s impacts on chronic disease development. Although related work has investigated associations with self-reported difficulties in ADL12,35,36 and performance-based tests14,37-39 alone, to our knowledge, our outcome is novel in its capture of more severe dysfunction that requires personal care for ADL and IADL. This may make this research more directly informative of the economic burdens associated with air pollution in older adults. If the observed associations were estimated without bias, nearly 729 727 new cases of loss of independence per year were attributable to traffic-related air pollution in the US, with a cost of $11.7 billion per year.
Although no other studies to our knowledge have assessed long-term exposure to pollution and lost independence, our findings are consistent with other research on physical and cognitive functional declines. For example, the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Study40 documented a cross-sectional association between an air pollution index and higher risks of physical functional declines measured by difficulties in performing ADL and longitudinal associations between increased PM2.5 levels and a reduction in hand grip strength and balance ability.37 Also in China, there has been evidence that pollution from household heating is a risk factor for functional declines.36,38 For example, in the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study,36 a sister study of HRS, burning of coal, wood, or crop residue for heating was associated with higher risks of ADL and IADL limitations compared with clean heating energy. A 2021 systematic review41 also found associations between PM2.5 levels and cognitive declines. In 2021, a systematic review and meta-analysis42 also suggested that PM2.5 and NO2 levels were risk factors associated with dementia.
Notably, we found evidence that long-term exposures to pollutants from traffic (ie, PM2.5 from road and nonroad traffic and NO2 levels) were more consistently associated with a need for help due to health or memory problems. This is plausible given that PM2.5 from traffic contains harmful chemicals, including heavy metals, black carbon, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons,43 that may translocate throughout the body in the bloodstream due to the particles’ small sizes (<0.1 μm).44 Our finding of increased toxic effects of traffic-related pollution is also consistent with findings from the Chicago Health and Aging Project14 that NO2 concentrations were associated with faster declines in basic physical functions, a common precursor of loss of independence. The finding is also consistent with a broader literature that suggests that compared with other sources, traffic-related air pollution may be associated with higher risks of chronic conditions, including CVD,8,45-47 respiratory disease,48 diabetes,49 and dementia,50 although we did not find a robust association of traffic-related PM2.5 levels with dementia in the HRS.51
Counter to our hypothesis, we found that lower O3 concentrations were associated with higher risks of loss of independence. Sensitivity analyses showed that these associations were robust to adjustment for temperature and green space. Similarly, these findings could not be explained by negative correlations with other measured pollutants. However, it is possible that these unexpected findings reflect the conversion of O3 into other highly oxidized pollutants in the atmosphere that may be important for health but are unmeasured. Notably, the very small literature on O3 levels and functional declines is inconsistent.41,52 While a Korean cohort study53 reported that higher O3 levels were associated with greater odds of frailty, higher O3 concentrations were associated with fewer disability days in a Toronto cohort.52 In another cross-sectional study of O3 levels and cognitive function,54 associations with executive function were observed only when levels were greater than 49 ppb, suggesting a complicated and nonlinear association of O3 with cognition. Ultimately, however, more evidence is needed to understand the association of O3 levels with loss of independence.
To our knowledge, this is the first study to directly evaluate associations between long-term exposure to air pollution and loss of independence as assessed by the use of informal or formal care for health or memory problems in later life. Relatedly, this research was conducted as a nationally representative study in the US, in which multiple air pollutants were estimated at respondent residential addresses and were at lower levels than in previous, related studies.12,35,37,38 Compared with using specific components as tracers for sources, our estimates more directly reflect sources. They also include primary emissions and secondary pollution generated from chemical reactions that would not exist if that source were removed.
Limitations
Our study has limitations that merit attention. First, our emphasis was on the loss of independence as measured by the use of care rather than the need for care. This raises concerns that our outcome may be associated with factors, like SES, that estimate the use of care and lead to outcome misclassification. However, we incorporated formal and informal care and included detailed adjustments for social supports and SES estimated at individual and neighborhood levels. Additionally, our findings were robust to excluding respondents who were socially isolated. We cannot completely rule out the possibility that our observed associations are attributable to unmeasured confounding by other factors, like access to nutritious food, but adjustment for SES and urbanicity and a flexible adjustment for place should help mitigate this risk. Moreover, although we assumed an irreversible pathway from living independently to loss of independence in our analysis, the truth may be more complex, with the possibility of recovering independence over time.
Regarding our exposure estimation, it is notable that our estimates of source-specific PM2.5 levels have limited temporal resolution. However, there is high temporal stability of emissions over the past decade for most sources, and our findings were robust to more extensive time-varying estimates of wildfire-related PM2.5 levels.31 Additionally, there is a risk of healthy survivor bias in a prospective study of older adults.55,56 If participants who remained in the study were less susceptible to pollution, then our associations would be biased toward the null.57 Our use of proxy respondents, information on respondents who died, and time-varying survey weights should mitigate selection bias, although higher RRs for younger respondents may still indicate healthy selection bias.
Conclusions
This cohort study found that higher long-term air pollution concentrations were associated with increased risks of lost independence due to health or memory problems among older adults, with especially high RRs and associations robust to adjustment found for pollution from traffic. These findings suggest that reducing exposures may be associated with diversion or delay of the need for care at older ages and enhanced ability to live independently.
