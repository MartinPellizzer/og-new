In conclusion, this study demonstrates that GUV222 light can influence SOA formation and composition through non-ozone pathways. The results highlight the importance of considering these pathways in understanding the impact of GUV222 on indoor air quality. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms underlying these processes and to develop strategies for minimizing their potential health effects. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the complex interactions between GUV222 light and SOA formation, which are essential for developing effective mitigation strategies for improving indoor air quality.
