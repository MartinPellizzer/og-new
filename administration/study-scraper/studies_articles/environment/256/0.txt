Understanding the atmospheric dynamics and chemistry of potentially habitable terrestrial exoplanets is crucial for interpreting ongoing efforts to simulate their atmospheres. Tidally locked habitable-zone planets like TRAPPIST-1e are particularly interesting targets, as they exhibit unique features such as extreme temperature differences between their day and night sides. However, previous studies have often relied on oversimplified models that neglect the complexities of Earth-like land-ocean distributions with orography. This study aims to bridge this gap by exploring the effects of such distributions on the atmospheric dynamics and chemistry of TRAPPIST-1e.
