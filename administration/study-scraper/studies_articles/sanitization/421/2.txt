The results showed that the modified hybrid process with UV irradiations achieved the highest removal efficiency of 86.9% for COD and 81.66% for turbidity under optimized conditions (DC volts of 10 V; catalyst dose of 1 g/L, and ozone dose of 0.6mg/min). The pharmaceuticals removal obtained for amoxicillin was 100%, while that for carbamazepine was 95%. The study demonstrated that the combined process was effective in treating pharmaceutical wastewater.
