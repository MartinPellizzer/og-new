In conclusion, the study highlights the importance of considering solar irradiance variability in understanding global climate change and other environmental phenomena. By projecting this understanding into the future, the researchers provide insight into the potential impacts of C21st climate change, recovery of the ozone layer, and changes to the space environment on earth-orbiting spacecraft. Overall, this study provides a valuable framework for understanding the complex relationships between solar irradiance, Earth's climate, and the Sun's magnetic activity cycles.
