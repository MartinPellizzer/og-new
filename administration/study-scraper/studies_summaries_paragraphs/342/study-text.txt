Here is a summary of the study in one paragraph, focusing on the information and data related to ozone:

Researchers employed a Hamiltonian operator based on unitary Lie algebra to compute the combinational vibrational frequencies of ozone, extending up to the sixth overtone. The results were compared with experimental findings and fundamental vibrational spectra determined by the Lie algebraic model, showing high accuracy and close alignment with experimental results. This study provides a reliable method for computing ozone's overtone frequencies, which is essential for understanding its molecular structure and behavior.
