The findings of this study highlight the importance of considering land use patterns when designing urban spaces. The strategy of physical separation of polluting sources and sensitive uses, also known as health buffers, can be an effective solution for reducing exposure to air pollution. Urban planners should prioritize zoning regulations that separate polluting activities from residential areas and promote green spaces to mitigate the effects of air pollution.
