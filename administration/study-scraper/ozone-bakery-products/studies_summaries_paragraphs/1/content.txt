Here is a summary of the study in one detailed paragraph, focusing on the information related to ozone:

The study evaluated the effect of ozonation on the shelf life of French dessert Cannelés liquid dough. The researchers prepared two types of dough using ozonated and non-ozonated flour, which were stored at 4 ± 2 °C for six weeks. Microbiological tests, pH measurements, and baking trials were conducted weekly to assess the dough's quality. Unfortunately, ozone treatment did not extend the shelf life of the liquid dough, as both types of dough deteriorated during storage, becoming unsuitable for baking after four weeks. Specifically, ozonated dough Canelés developed a runny consistency, stuck to moulds, and had an unpleasant smell, while non-ozonated dough went mouldy. The results suggest that ozonation did not have a significant impact on the shelf life of Cannelés liquid dough.
