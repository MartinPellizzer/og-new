Here is a summary of the study in one detailed paragraph (60-80 words):

Ambient ozone (O3) exposure was found to be positively associated with insulin resistance (IR) in humans, and telomere shortening played a role in this association. Longitudinal studies using data from the Henan Rural Cohort showed that O3 exposure was linked to IR markers, with relative telomere length (RTL) mediating 11.92-60.36% of these associations. In mice experiments, O3 exposure led to telomere shortening, glucose accumulation reduction, and decreased telomerase reverse transcriptase activity.
