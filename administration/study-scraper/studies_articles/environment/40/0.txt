Ozone (O3) pollution is a significant environmental issue in Northeast China, particularly in heavy industrial cities like Siping. In recent years, particulate matter (PM) pollution has decreased significantly, while O3 pollution has increased sharply. This study aims to investigate the spatiotemporal characteristics of O3 pollution and its source contributions in Siping, providing valuable insights for policy suggestions.
