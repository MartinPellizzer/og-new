Here are five detailed paragraphs based on the scientific study:

**Paragraph 1**
Cranberries are a highly regarded fruit due to their potential health benefits and antioxidant properties. Vaccinium macrocarpon is one of the most commonly cultivated species for commercial use. However, reducing losses in the cranberry supply chain involves implementing strategic measures to minimize wastage and enhance overall efficiency. To extend the shelf life of fruits and vegetables, conventional chemical treatments have been introduced, but more ecological technologies are being sought to ensure consumer safety and raw material quality.

**Paragraph 2**
The effectiveness of a constructed system enabling simultaneous ozonation and UV-C irradiation of cranberry fruits was evaluated in this research. The system consisted of a spiral conveyor allowing for a continuous process of ozonation and UV-C radiation. Ozone gas was supplied through nozzles, and the chamber was equipped with an inlet and outlet for fruit transportation. UV-C ultraviolet radiation sources were located in the lower and upper housings of the chamber. The research material consisted of fresh cranberries harvested using the wet harvesting method.

**Paragraph 3**
The results showed that applying the ozonation process to fruits, as facilitated by the developed solution's throughput, led to a reduction in microbiological load (fermentation bacteria count reduction by 3.4 log cfu-1), resulting in an extension of their shelf life and a reduction in storage losses (8.98% by mass). The implementation of the developed solution reduced water loss and limited fruit losses during storage. Storage tests lasting 42 days were conducted, during which the microbiological load, water content, mechanical properties, and storage losses of the cranberry fruits were analyzed.

**Paragraph 4**
The combined application of ozonation and UV-C irradiation was found to have a synergistic effect in reducing microorganisms on cranberries. The results demonstrate that this non-toxic and non-invasive method is an effective solution for extending the shelf life of cranberries. Additionally, this technology has positive environmental effects by reducing waste and making the cultivation of cranberries more sustainable and environmentally friendly.

**Paragraph 5**
In conclusion, this research demonstrates the effectiveness of a constructed system enabling simultaneous ozonation and UV-C irradiation of cranberry fruits to extend their shelf life. The results show that this method can reduce microbiological load, storage losses, and water loss while maintaining the quality of the fruits. This technology has significant potential for implementation in the food industry, particularly in post-harvest processing of fruits and vegetables.
