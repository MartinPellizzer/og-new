ABSTRACT
We employed the Hamiltonian operator based on the unitary Lie algebra to compute the combinational vibrational frequencies of ozone, extending up to the sixth overtone. A comparison between experimental findings and the fundamental vibrational spectra, as determined by the Lie algebraic model, was carried out. It has been affirmed that the outcomes derived from this approach exhibit a high level of accuracy, closely aligning with the experimental results.
