This study employed a combination of methods to examine long-term changes in surface O3 concentrations and identify contributing factors. Satellite-based formaldehyde (HCHO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) columns were used to track volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions, respectively. Additionally, the HCHO/NO2 ratio was calculated to evaluate the impact of these precursors on O3 formation. The study also analyzed ground-based observations of surface O3 concentrations at multiple sites in the NCP.
