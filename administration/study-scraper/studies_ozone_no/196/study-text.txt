Abstract
The effect of ozone addition on soot formation in partially premixed laminar methane flames at two equivalence ratios, Φ = 11.9 and Φ = 7.6 (with 500 ppm and 570 ppm of ozone, respectively), has been investigated. Soot particles collected in the centerline of the flames at several heights above the burner have been examined in terms of size, morphology, and chemical/structural characteristics, by differential mobility analysis, atomic force microscopy, and Raman spectroscopy respectively. The results show that adding ozone to the flame reduces the number of soot particles, as well as their average size. The typical height profiles of the collected particles on substrates are shown to be also flatter as compared to the pristine flames, possibly indicating a lower level of cross-linking in the aromatic network forming the particles. Also, the Raman spectroscopy analysis indicates that ozone addition promotes the formation of larger aromatic soot constituents. Moreover, within the selected experimental conditions and ozone concentration of several hundred parts per million, the flame temperature is unaffected regardless of the presence or absence of ozone. Consequently, it can be inferred that the observed modifications in soot characteristics are predominantly attributed to chemical factors. The observed effects are all consistent with a possible chemical interaction of atomic oxygen, resulting from the decomposition of ozone in the post-flame zone, with aromatic π-radicals, precursors of the soot particles.

1. Introduction
Due to the negative effects on human health and the climate caused by particles released into the atmosphere
[1]
,
[2]
, the formation and growth of soot is an active and ongoing research field in combustion. Soot particles can have different sizes, nanostructures, and chemical compositions based on the combustion conditions. Factors influencing this variability include flame temperature, fuel composition, pressure, residence time, and premixing level.
In fuel-rich conditions, the promotion of benzene formation, along with larger polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), occurs through fuel pyrolysis and oxidation. PAHs are universally acknowledged as fundamental components and precursors of carbonaceous nanoparticles. The initial step in the soot formation process is particle nucleation, the transition from gas-phase molecules to solid particles, which remains a focal point of ongoing research
[3]
. Various mechanisms are proposed and actively debated to describe the particle inception process
[3]
,
[4]
,
[5]
,
[6]
. Once formed, newly nucleated soot particles can undergo processes such as coagulation, coalescence, and surface growth through the addition of gas-phase compounds, resulting in the formation of larger particles. Further modifications in the chemical and structural composition of soot may occur due to carbonization and oxidation reactions prevalent throughout the flame. Consequently, flame-formed soot particles can exhibit diverse chemical and physical characteristics, influencing crucial properties such as oxidation reactivity

Current advancements in our comprehension of soot formation and evolution mechanisms have been notable, owing to the recent use of innovative experimental
[13]
,
[14]
,
[15]
and theoretical methods
[4]
,
[16]
. One of the significant breakthroughs in the field involves the identification of π-radicals as critical intermediates in the inception and growth of soot particles. Recent investigations have supported the existence of molecular clustering reaction pathways driven by radical-chain reactions of π-radicals yet pointing toward the formation of covalently bound complexes
[13]

[14]

[15]

Within the context of purely laminar premixed flames, soot formation starts immediately after the flame front, with the formation of nucleation or incipient soot particles whose size is typically 2–3 nm in diameter
[12]
,
[17]
,
[18]
,
[19]
. These nanoparticles undergo further growth within the flame, reaching dimensions of up to tens of nanometers with a particle size distribution having a bimodal shape
[6]
. In purely diffusive flames, soot predominantly forms and attains its peak concentration in the annular region proximate to the maximum radial flame temperature on the fuel side
[20]
. Nonetheless, investigations by various researchers have identified soot precursor nanoparticles within the flame core
[21]
,
[22]

Although the use of partially premixed flames is prevalent in numerous practical devices, such as gas turbines, industrial furnaces, internal combustion engines, and burners for boilers
[24]
, it has garnered relatively less investigation with respect to pure premixed or diffusive flames, from which the impact of combustion parameters on soot formation, including particles’ physicochemical properties and nanostructure characteristics, has been mainly derived. A partially premixed flame arises when the fuel is mixed with a sub-stoichiometric amount of air – to generate a local fuel-rich mixture – before reaching the reaction zone, where additional air becomes available. The effects of partial premixing on soot formation have been explored using diverse techniques such as laser-induced incandescence
[25]
, light absorption
[26]
, high-resolution TEM
[27]
, and more recently thermophoretic particle densitometry (TPD)
[28]
. These studies collectively revealed that the introduction of oxygen into the fuel stream influences both the soot volume fraction and the structural properties of particles, including lamellae curvature
[27]
. Particularly, it has been shown that the increase in premixing results in an initial increase in the particle volume fraction, which then decreases as the equivalent ratio further decreases
[28]
.
Today, several strategies have been developed to improve combustion efficiency and reduce pollutant emissions, including soot. Among these, for instance, plasma-assisted combustion exhibits extensive potential for enhancing combustion efficiency and flame control, while simultaneously mitigating NOx and particulate matter emissions
[29]
,
[30]
. Plasma-flame coupling produces a variety of reactive species, including free electrons, ions, active radicals, and excited molecules. These compounds collectively enhance the oxidation of fuel, resulting in a shorter ignition delay time and faster flame propagation
[31]
. Nevertheless, the difficulty of generating stable, uniform, non-equilibrium plasmas, particularly at high pressures, can be mitigated by the injection of excited molecules, characterized by longer lifetimes
[32]
. Among the active molecules, ozone (O3) stands out as particularly promising
[32]
. An inherent advantage of O3 lies in its production from oxygen molecules, the primary oxidizer in nearly all combustion systems, thus preventing the need for additional storage of fluids or gases. In addition, ozone exhibits a long lifetime and strong oxidizing properties
[32]
. Early investigations have demonstrated that O3 can play a multifaceted role, including accelerating ignition, enhancing flame propagation, contributing to flame stabilization, as well as reducing pollutant formation
[32]
. Despite the demonstrated positive effect of ozone in improving combustion, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, studies devoted to a fundamental understanding of the effect of ozone on soot formation in flames have been rarely performed. Ozone injection into flames is a simple means of increasing atomic oxygen concentration in flames
[32]
. Atomic oxygen has been shown to rapidly react with localized π-radical sites, e.g., fluorenyl-type radicals
[33]
, which may play a significant role in PAH clustering and soot formation
[13]
,
[14]
,
[15]
,
[16]
. It was thus speculated that ozone injection into flames may also interact with the soot formation process
[3]
,
[13]
. Only very recently, Ying and Liu
[34]
reported on the effect of ozone on the formation and evolution of soot in an inverse diffusion flame of ethylene. The ozone in flames promoted the formation of free radicals and active substances, leading to slightly increased soot formation and agglomeration processes. Higher ozone concentration resulted in larger primary particle diameters, increased agglomeration, elevated soot surface oxygen content, and a lower sp2/sp3 ratio, indicating a higher oxidation reactivity in the generated soot. In literature, an O3 concentration range between 10 ppm and 1000 ppm is usually adopted for real-based scenarios, such as internal combustion engines
[35]
,
[36]
, whereas lab-scale analyses also cover higher and wider ranges, such as 2750 ppm and 5500 ppm in the work of Ying and Liu
[34]
, or 100 ppm and 5000 ppm in Cheng et al.
[37]
.
In this work, the effect of ozone on particle nucleation and soot formation is analyzed in two partially premixed laminar flames of methane operated with two equivalence ratios, i.e., different amounts of the primary air added to the fuel stream. The ozone addition has been obtained by partial conversion of the oxygen in the premixing primary air, thus without altering the flame equivalence ratio. The concentrations of the added ozone explored in our work, 500 ppm and 570 ppm, lie in the range investigated in similar works
[34]
,
[35]
,
[36]
,
[37]
. Soot extracted from the flames with ozone at different heights has been characterized in comparison with soot formed from the same flames without ozone. Differential mobility analysis, atomic force microscopy, and Raman spectroscopy have been used to retrieve information on particle size distributions, morphological characteristics, and chemical/structural properties of the soot with and without the presence of ozone.
2. Experimental
A co-flow partially premixed laminar methane/air flame with and without ozone in the premixing air was tested at two equivalence ratios, Φ = 11.9 and Φ = 7.6. The burner was the same as in previous studies
[28]
and was built similarly to the one in ref.
[38]
. The fuel/air mixture (at ambient temperature) flows through an uncooled vertical tube (I.D.∼1.2 cm), while secondary air flows through a concentric tube (I.D.∼10.8 cm)
[22]
. Flames are stabilized at the burner exit by reducing the air annulus with a 5.5 cm I.D. ring. A flux of secondary air was provided to stabilize the investigated flames. A schematic of the burner set-up is reported in
Fig. 1
. The flow conditions of the investigated flames are reported in
Table 1
. Our experimental setup is equipped with mass-flow controllers (from Bronkhorst, models F-201AV and F-201CV), used to separately regulate the amount of primary air and fuel sent to the flame. Moreover, a primary flow calibrator (from Gilian, model Gilibrator-2) was used to precisely calibrate the mass-flow controllers, in order to correlate the nominal values of the flowrates with the real flowrates of oxidizer and fuel reaching the flame. The secondary air flow is controlled with a flowmeter (from ASA, model E5-2600).

Φ11.9O3 11.9 500 0.40 0.32 4000
A total of four flame conditions were investigated. To understand how flame residence time impacts soot formation, we chose equivalence ratios similar to the ones used in prior studies of partially premixed methane/air flames
[38]
so to have lightly sooting conditions and isolate and observe the effect of ozone addition on the soot formation process. However, for a clearer analysis, we opted for slightly richer flames (Φ = 7.6 and 11.9) compared to the previous studies on ozone addition
[39]
. While a higher equivalence ratio would increase soot volume, it would also decrease oxygen content, making it difficult to study early soot formation and the chemical influence of ozone. Conversely, very lean flames (lower equivalence ratio) would produce minimal soot, hindering analysis techniques like Raman spectroscopy. Hence, two partially premixed methane/air flames at Φ = 7.6 and Φ = 11.9 were examined with and without ozone addition in the premixing air. Overall, a fixed amount of ozone, corresponding to roughly 500 ppm was prepared by turning on the UV lamp of the ozone generator, Model 1001 Jelight Company Inc. The ozone concentration was determined via a Model 205 Dual Beam Ozone Monitor (2B Technologies). The
