Duckweed has emerged as a promising crop for sustainable food and feed production, wastewater treatment, environmental monitoring, biofuels, bioplastics, dietary supplements, and pharmaceuticals. Its benefits include clonal propagation, high growth rate, small plant size, and the ability to utilize the whole plant for most applications. However, commercial duckweed cultivation has faced limited success due to the undomesticated nature of the plant and lack of standardized abiotic and biotic parameters. This thesis aims to overcome these challenges by developing a controlled environment agriculture (CEA) system using vertical towers to maximize biomass production.
