The results showed that across all locations, an increase of 1 μg/m3 in the mean daily concentration of wildfire-related O3 during lag 0–2 days was associated with increases of 0.55% (95% CI 0.29 to 0.80) in daily all-cause mortality, 0.44% (–0.10 to 0.99) in daily cardiovascular mortality, and 0.82% (0.18 to 1.47) in daily respiratory mortality. The associations of daily mortality rates with wildfire-related O3 exposure showed substantial geographical heterogeneity at the country and regional levels.
