Here is a detailed summary of the study, focusing on the information and data related to ozone:

The study aimed to determine the optimal concentration of ozone-containing mixture for safe use in clinical conditions during hyperbaric oxygenation. The researchers conducted an experiment using 20 white laboratory rats divided into two groups: one breathed an ozone-containing mixture for 7 days, while the other breathed a steam-water ozone-containing mixture. The results showed that exposure to the ozone-containing mixture did not cause pathological changes or significant stress response in the animals' organs and systems. Furthermore, the method was proven to be safe for use in confined spaces without harming patients or medical staff. The study also measured the concentration of residual ozone in the room after the therapeutic procedure, which did not exceed the permissible level. Overall, the study suggested that the optimal parameters of ozone production and supply have been proposed, making it possible to recommend the use of an ozone-containing steam-water mixture for clinical practice in conditions of massive tissue infection as a factor of external physical influence with pronounced bactericidal and bacteriostatic properties.
