Abstract
Non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC), serving as crucial precursors of O3, have a significant impact on atmospheric oxidative capacity and O3 formation. However, both anthropogenic and biogenic NMVOC emissions remain subject to considerable uncertainty. Here, we extended the Regional multi-Air Pollutant Assimilation System (RAPAS) using the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) algorithm to optimize NMVOC emissions in China in August 2022 by assimilating TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) HCHO retrievals. We also simultaneously optimize NOx emissions by assimilating in situ NO2 observations to address the chemical feedback among VOCs–NOx–O3. Furthermore, a process-based analysis was employed to quantify the impact of NMVOC emission changes on various chemical reactions related to O3 formation and depletion. NMVOC emissions exhibited a substantial reduction of 50.2 %, especially in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, revealing a prior overestimation of biogenic NMVOC emissions due to an extreme heat wave. Compared to the forecast with prior NMVOC emissions, the forecast with posterior emissions significantly improved HCHO simulations, reducing biases by 75.7 %, indicating a notable decrease in posterior emission uncertainties. The forecast with posterior emissions also effectively corrected the overestimation of O3 in forecasts with prior emissions, reducing biases by 49.3 %. This can be primarily attributed to a significant decrease in the RO2+NO reaction rate and an increase in the NO2+OH reaction rate in the afternoon, thus limiting O3 generation. Sensitivity analyses emphasized the necessity of considering both NMVOC and NOx emissions for a comprehensive assessment of O3 chemistry. This study enhances our understanding of the effects of NMVOC emissions on O3 production and can contribute to the development of effective emission reduction policies.

1 Introduction
Since the Chinese government implemented the Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan in 2013, there has been a notable reduction in NOx emissions (Zheng et al., 2018). However, despite these advancements, the issue of O3 pollution persists and, in certain cases, has shown signs of worsening (Ren et al., 2022). The increase in O3 concentration can be attributed not only to adverse meteorological conditions but also predominantly to unbalanced joint control of non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) and nitrogen oxides (NOx; Li et al., 2020). NMVOCs are vital precursors of O3 and have a substantial impact on atmospheric oxidation capacity, thereby altering the lifetimes of other pollutants. Accurately quantifying NMVOC emissions holds significant importance in investigating their impact on O3 chemistry and in formulating emission reduction policies.
Anthropogenic NMVOC emissions have traditionally been estimated using a bottom-up method. However, the accuracy and timeliness of these estimations face challenges owing to the scarcity of local measurements for emission factors, the incompleteness and unreliability of activity data, and the diverse range of species and technologies involved (Cao et al., 2018; Hong et al., 2017). Furthermore, uncertainties arise in model-ready NMVOC emissions due to spatial and temporal allocations using various “proxy” data for different source sectors (Li et al., 2017a). Li et al. (2021) reported substantial discrepancies among emission estimates in various studies, ranging 23 % to 56 %. Biogenic NMVOC emissions are typically estimated using models like the Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature (MEGAN; Guenther et al., 2012) and the Biogenic Emission Inventory System (BEIS; Pierce et al., 1998). NMVOC emissions result from the multiplication of plant-specific standard emission rates by dimensionless activity factors. Nonetheless, apart from inaccuracies in the distribution of plant functional types, empirical parameterization, especially concerning responses to temperature and drought stress, can introduce substantial uncertainties (Angot et al., 2020; Seco et al., 2022; Jiang et al., 2018). Warneke et al. (2010) determined isoprene emission rates through field measurements and conducted a comparison to MEGAN and BEIS estimates, revealing a notable tendency for MEGAN to overestimate emissions while BEIS consistently underestimated them. Similarly, Marais et al. (2014) found that MEGAN's isoprene emission estimates were 5–10 times higher than the canopy-scale flux measurements obtained from African field campaigns.
A top-down approach utilizing observed data has been developed for estimating VOC emissions. For instance, techniques based on aircraft- and ground-based field measurements such as the source–receptor relationships algorithm with Lagrangian particle dispersion model (Fang et al., 2016), mixed layer gradient techniques (Mo et al., 2020), eddy covariance flux measurements (Yuan et al., 2015), and the box model (Wang et al., 2020) have been employed to complement or verify bottom-up results. However, these approaches do not comprehensively consider the complex nonlinear chemical reactions and transport processes that VOCs undergo in the atmosphere. Formaldehyde (HCHO) and glyoxal (CHOCHO) in the atmosphere serve as crucial oxidization intermediates for various VOCs (Hong et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2012). Satellite-based observations can readily detect their presence in the form of vertical column density (VCD) from space, making them widely utilized for estimating NMVOC emissions. A commonly used approach assumes that the observed HCHO/CHOCHO columns are locally linearly correlated with VOC emission rates (Palmer et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2012). However, this approach does not consider the spatial offset resulting from chemistry reactions and transport processes. Chaliyakunnel et al. (2019) conducted a Bayesian analysis to derive an optimal estimate of VOC emissions using HCHO measurements over the Indian subcontinent. Their results indicated that biogenic VOC emissions modeled by MEGAN v2.1 were overestimated by approximately 30 %–60 %, whereas anthropogenic VOC emissions derived from the REanalysis of the TROpospheric chemical composition (RETRO) inventory were underestimated by 13 %–16 %. Cao et al. (2018) employed the GEOS-Chem model and its adjoint, incorporating tropospheric HCHO and CHOCHO column data from the GOME-2A and Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) satellites as constraints, to quantify Chinese NMVOC emissions. They demonstrated a low bias in the MEGAN model, in contrast to the significant overestimation shown in Bauwens et al. (2016), especially in southern China.
Several investigations have been conducted to explore the implications of inverted VOC emissions on surface O3. For instance, using the Eulerian box model, Zhou et al. (2023) employed concurrent VOC measurements to constrain anthropogenic VOC emissions. This led to improved simulations of VOCs and O3, with a reduction in high emissions by 15 %–36 % in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region. Local model biases in simulating the oxidation of NMVOCs and O3 are closely related to uncertainties in NOx emissions (Wolfe et al., 2016; Chan Miller et al., 2017). To tackle these critical questions, Kaiser et al. (2018) applied an adjoint algorithm to estimate isoprene emission over the southeast US by downwardly adjusting anthropogenic NOx emissions by 50 % to rectify NO2 simulations. Their findings indicated that isoprene emissions from MEGAN v2.1 were overestimated by an average of 40 %, slightly lower than the 50 % reduction in Bauwens et al. (2016). Souri et al. (2020) simultaneously optimized NMVOC and NOx emissions utilizing Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite (OMPS-NM) HCHO and OMI NO2 retrievals in east Asia. They found that predominantly anthropogenic NMVOC emissions from the mosaic Asian anthropogenic emission inventory (MIX-Asia) 2010 increased over the North China Plain (NCP), whereas predominantly biogenic NMVOC emissions from MEGAN v2.1 decreased over southern China after the adjustment. Unfortunately, the posterior simulations exacerbated the overestimation of O3 levels in northern China.
Most studies regarding the inversion of NMVOC emissions or its impact on O3 neglected the uncertainties associated with NOx-dependent production or loss of NMVOC oxidation and O3. An iteratively nonlinear joint inversion of NOx and NMVOCs using multi-species observations is expected to minimize the uncertainties in their emissions and is well-suited to address the intricate relationship among VOCs–NOx–O3. In this study, we extended the Regional multi-Air Pollutant Assimilation System (RAPAS) with the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) assimilation algorithm to enhance the optimization of NMVOC emissions over China, utilizing the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) HCHO retrievals with high spatial coverage and resolution. To more accurately quantify the impact of NMVOC emissions on O3, NOx emissions were simultaneously adjusted using nationwide in situ NO2 observations. Process analysis was subsequently employed to quantify various chemical pathways associated with O3 formation and loss. Through a top-down constraint on both types of emission, this study aims to offer a more scientific insight into the consequences of optimizing NMVOC emissions on O3 and to contribute to the development of appropriate emission reduction policies.
2 Data and methods
2.1 Data assimilation system
The RAPAS system (Feng et al., 2023) has been developed based on a regional chemical transport model (CTM) and on ensemble square root filter (EnSRF) assimilation modules (Whitaker and Hamill, 2002), which are employed to simulate atmospheric compositions and infer anthropogenic emissions by assimilating surface observations, respectively (Feng et al., 2022, 2020). The inversion process follows a two-step procedure within each inversion window, in which the emissions are inferred first and then input into the Community Multiscale Air Quality Modeling System (CMAQ) to simulate initial conditions of the next window. Meanwhile, the optimized emissions are transferred to the next window as prior emissions. The two-step inversion strategy facilitates error propagation and iterative emission optimization, which have proven the superiority and robustness of our system in estimating emissions (Feng et al., 2023). In this study, we extended the data frame to include the assimilation of TROPOMI HCHO retrievals to optimize NMVOC emissions. Concise descriptions of the forecast model, data assimilation approach, and experimental settings follow.
2.1.1 Atmospheric transport model
The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF v4.0) model (Skamarock and Klemp, 2008) and the CMAQ (v5.0.2; Byun and Schere, 2006) were applied to simulate meteorological conditions and atmospheric chemistry, respectively. WRF simulations were conducted with a 27 km horizontal resolution, covering the entire mainland of China on a grid of 225×165 cells (Fig. 1). The CMAQ was run over the same domain but with the removal of three grid cells on each side of the WRF domain. The vertical settings in WRF and CMAQ were the same as in Feng et al. (2020). To account for the rapid expansion of urbanization, we updated underlying surface information for urban and built-up land using the MODIS Land Cover Type product (MCD12C1) Version 6.1 from 2022. Chemical lateral boundary conditions for NO, NO2, HCHO, and O3 were extracted from the output of the global CTM (i.e., the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model, WACCM) with a resolution of 0.9°×1.25° at 6 h intervals (Marsh et al., 2013). Meanwhile, boundary conditions for the other NMVOCs were obtained directly from background profiles. In the first data assimilation (DA) window, initial chemical conditions (excluding NMVOCs) were also derived from the WACCM outputs, whereas in subsequent windows, they were derived through forward simulation using optimized emissions from the previous window. Table S1 in the Supplement lists the detailed physical and chemical configurations. To assess the impact of updated NMVOC emissions on O3 production efficiency, we further decoupled the contribution of the primary chemical processes from the O3 levels using the CMAQ integrated reaction rate (IRR) analysis.
