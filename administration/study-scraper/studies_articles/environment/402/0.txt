Urban green spaces (UGS) have been widely advocated as a means to mitigate urban atmospheric pollution. However, recent studies have suggested that UGS can actually exacerbate ozone (O3) levels in certain conditions. This study aims to investigate the impact of biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) emissions from UGS on urban O3 levels in Guangzhou, China.
