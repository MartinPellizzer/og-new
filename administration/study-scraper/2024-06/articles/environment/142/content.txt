Here are five detailed paragraphs based on the scientific study:

**Paragraph 1**

Atmospheric pollution is a growing concern worldwide, and Ecuador is no exception. The city of Cuenca, in particular, has been affected by urban and industrial growth, which has intensified air pollution. This study aims to analyze the quality of associations between atmospheric pollutants and meteorological variables by seasonality during the year 2018. Understanding these relationships is crucial for developing effective strategies to mitigate the impact of air pollution on public health and quality of life.

**Paragraph 2**

To achieve this goal, a dataset was used that included levels of atmospheric pollutants and meteorological variables. A decision tree approach was employed to analyze the data, with preprocessing steps including cleaning, discretization, and seasonal modeling. This methodology allowed for the identification of relationships between the variables and the impact of seasonality on these associations.

**Paragraph 3**

The results show that temperature and UV radiation have a significant influence on ozone levels, with variations in precision observed throughout the year. Notably, the accuracy of the model decreases at high levels of contamination, highlighting the need for adjustments to account for these extreme conditions. The study also demonstrates the applicability of machine learning techniques in environmental analysis.

**Paragraph 4**

The findings of this study underscore the importance of integrated approaches for air quality management. By considering the relationships between atmospheric pollutants and meteorological variables by seasonality, policymakers can develop targeted strategies to mitigate the impact of air pollution. Furthermore, the results emphasize the need for ongoing monitoring and adaptation of models to ensure effective air quality management.

**Paragraph 5**

In conclusion, this study contributes to the understanding of the complex relationships between atmospheric pollutants and meteorological variables in Cuenca, Ecuador. The findings highlight the importance of seasonality in shaping these associations and suggest that machine learning techniques can be valuable tools for environmental analysis. By integrating these insights into air quality management strategies, policymakers can work towards reducing the negative impacts of air pollution on public health and quality of life in Cuenca and beyond.
