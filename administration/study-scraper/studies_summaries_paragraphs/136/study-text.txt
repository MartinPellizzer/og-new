Here is a summary of the study in one detailed paragraph, focusing on ozone-related information:

The study examined the effect of ozonated Aloe vera oil on radiation dermatitis wound healing in Sprague Dawley rats. The results showed that topical application of ozonated Aloe vera oil at concentrations of 300/600/1200 mg/ml significantly accelerated wound healing by reducing tumor necrosis factor-alpha expression, neutrophil infiltration, and endothelial damage, while increasing tumor growth factor beta, platelet-derived growth factor, and fibroblast count. In contrast, hydrocortisone ointment and Aloe vera oil alone did not exhibit significant effects. The study's findings suggest that ozonated Aloe vera oil exhibits antioxidant and bactericidal properties, which may contribute to its wound-healing potential. Overall, the results indicate that ozonated Aloe vera oil can accelerate radiation dermatitis healing in rats, making it a promising therapeutic approach for managing this common side effect of radiation therapy.
