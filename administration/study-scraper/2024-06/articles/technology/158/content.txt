Here are five detailed paragraphs based on the scientific study:

**Paragraph 1**
Adverse birth outcomes, such as low birth weight and preterm birth, have been linked to air pollution exposure during pregnancy. The present study aimed to investigate whether maternal exposure to air pollution and greenness during pregnancy is associated with offspring birth weight and preterm birth in Northern European countries. Using data from the Respiratory Health in Northern Europe (RHINE) study, we analyzed exposures to particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), black carbon (BC), and greenness (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index [NDVI]) during pregnancy.

**Paragraph 2**
The RHINE study is a prospective questionnaire-based cohort study that included seven study centers in Northern Europe. We analyzed data on 4286 singleton births from 2358 mothers who participated in the study between 1990 and 2010. Exposure to air pollutants was assigned using annual average concentrations from the NordicWelfAir inventory, while greenness exposure was assessed using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) calculated from satellite images. We also collected data on potential covariates associated with exposure and/or outcome, including maternal age, parity, smoking status, and comorbidities.

**Paragraph 3**
Our analysis found that increases in air pollution exposures during pregnancy were associated with decreased birth weight, with the strongest association seen for PM2.5. However, ozone (O3) showed an opposite association. In contrast, increases in greenness exposure were associated with increased birth weight. No significant associations were found between air pollutants and preterm birth. The median exposures to PM2.5, PM10, NO2, O3, BC, and NDVI300m during pregnancy were 8.4(5.0) µg/m3, 14.4(8.3) µg/m3, 14.0(11.0) µg/m3, 54.7(10.2) µg/m3, 0.47(0.41) µg/m3, and 0.31(0.20), respectively.

**Paragraph 4**
Our findings suggest that increased greenness and decreased air pollution may contribute to healthier pregnancies and improve overall health in the next generation. The associations estimated for NDVI300m exposure were independent from concomitant air pollution exposures, as illustrated by mutually adjusted models. Sensitivity and secondary analyses validated the robustness of the observed associations. Furthermore, our study highlights the need to adhere to World Health Organization (WHO) air quality guidelines levels.

**Paragraph 5**
In conclusion, our study provides evidence that maternal exposure to air pollution during pregnancy is associated with decreased birth weight, while increased greenness exposure is associated with increased birth weight in Northern European countries. These findings emphasize the importance of reducing air pollution emissions and promoting green environments to improve maternal and child health outcomes. Further research is needed to investigate the mechanisms underlying these associations and to develop effective strategies for mitigating the effects of air pollution on pregnancy outcomes.
