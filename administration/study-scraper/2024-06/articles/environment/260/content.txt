Here are the five detailed paragraphs using the information from the study:

**Paragraph 1**
In this study, researchers introduced a novel heteroleptic indium complex, which incorporates an amidinate ligand, as a high-temperature atomic layer deposition (ALD) precursor. The goal was to develop a stable and effective precursor for the production of indium oxide thin-film transistors (In2O3TFTs). This study aimed to investigate the thermal stability and application potential of this novel precursor in the fabrication of In2O3TFTs.

**Paragraph 2**
The researchers employed density functional theory to determine the most stable structure of the novel indium complex. The complex was then synthesized and its thermal stability up to 375 °C was evaluated. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) was performed using this precursor at a wide range of window processing temperatures, including 200 °C, 300 °C, and 350 °C, with ozone (O3) as the source gas. The growth per cycle of ALD was measured, ranging from 0.06 to 0.1 nm/cycle at different deposition temperatures.

**Paragraph 3**
The crystalline structure of the deposited films was analyzed using X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. At a relatively low deposition temperature of 200 °C, an amorphous morphology was observed, while at 300 °C and 350 °C, crystalline structures were evident. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis revealed that the OH-related product was as low as 1% with increasing deposition temperature. The researchers also fabricated In2O3TFTs and evaluated their field-effect mobility, threshold voltage (Vth), and stability.

**Paragraph 4**
The results of this study demonstrate the potential of the novel DBADMI precursor for producing high-quality films and stable crystalline phases over a wide processing temperature range. The precursor's stability at high deposition temperatures makes it ideal for various applications. The increase in field-effect mobility with minimal change in Vth suggests that this precursor can be used to fabricate high-performance In2O3TFTs.

**Paragraph 5**
In conclusion, the DBADMI precursor shows great promise for the fabrication of indium oxide thin-film transistors over a wide range of processing temperatures. The precursor's thermal stability and ability to produce high-quality films make it an attractive choice for various applications. Further research can explore the potential of this novel precursor in other fields, such as optoelectronics and energy storage devices.
