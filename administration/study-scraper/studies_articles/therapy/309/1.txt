The study employed a culture-independent approach to generate bacterial community profiles from two Duckweed Production Module (DPMÂ®) systems with intermittent aqueous ozonation of re-circulating growth media and one without. The system was designed to optimize abiotic parameters, including temperature, pH, and light intensity, and to develop management protocols for increasing harvest yield and production duration per crop. Bacterial community profiles were generated using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and colony-forming unit (CFU) counts were used to assess the efficiency of aqueous ozone treatment in reducing total bacterial load.
