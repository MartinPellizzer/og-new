Here is a summary of the study in 1 detailed paragraph:

Exposure to ozone (O3) during gestation affects neurodevelopmental susceptibility, with significant differences observed when comparing exposure at gestational day (GD) 10 versus GD20. Whole-body inhalation of O3 or filtered air in pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats revealed altered protein abundance and posttranslational states in the fetal brain, which were analyzed using mass spectrometry and immunohistochemistry. The results showed that GD10 exposure predicted increased apoptosis (p-value = 0.0018) and decreased neuritogenesis (p-value = 0.00128), with acute apoptosis from O3 exposure decreasing neuronal outbranching. These findings suggest that gestational ozone exposure may contribute to cognitive and behavioral childhood performance issues, such as ADHD, memory deficiencies, and motor impairments, which disproportionately affect urban children.
