The results show that the updated model demonstrates a significantly enhanced capability in simulating O3 over the CONUS by reducing the positive bias during both day and night. Specifically, the mean bias of hourly O3 is reduced by 50% and 72% for hourly and maximum daily 8-hour average O3, respectively. Spatially, the updated model lowers the positive bias of hourly O3 in all ten EPA regions, particularly within the Great Plains. Additionally, the updates induce uniformly lower PM2.5 concentrations across the CONUS domain.
