The agreement between different observational records provides strong evidence of ozone recovery in the stratosphere. The use of additional dynamical proxies in the LOTUS model did not significantly change trends but reduced trend uncertainties in the upper stratosphere and at higher latitudes. This suggests that incorporating these proxies can improve model accuracy.
