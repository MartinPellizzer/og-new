**Paragraph 1**
Ozone (O3) pollution is a growing concern worldwide, affecting human health, crop yield, and vegetation growth. Chronic exposure to O3 concentrations can cause oxidative stress in plants, leading to visible injuries, chlorophyll loss, and membrane impairment. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of wood distillate (WD), a plant-based biostimulant, in protecting basil plants against ozone damage.

**Paragraph 2**
The experimental design consisted of four groups: control plants exposed to filtered air, O3-treated plants, WD-treated plants, and O3+WD-treated plants. The plants were grown in controlled environmental conditions and exposed to 80 ppb O3 for 28 days. Foliar applications of WD (0.2%, v/v) were made once a week for four consecutive weeks. The WD used was produced by BioDea through the pyrolysis process of sweet chestnut wood, extracted via steam distillation.

**Paragraph 3**
The results showed that O3-treated plants exhibited severe chlorotic spots and chlorophyll loss (-25% compared to controls). In contrast, O3+WD-treated plants had reduced visible injuries, preserved membrane integrity, and produced antioxidant compounds such as abscisic and salicylic acids (+21 and +62%, respectively). The WD application also resulted in a significant increase in biomass production.

**Paragraph 4**
These findings suggest that WD has a protective effect against O3-induced oxidative stress in basil plants. The mechanism of action may involve the induction of antioxidant defense systems, supporting plant tolerance to environmental stresses. Future studies should investigate the optimal application rate and timing of WD to maximize its protective effects. Additionally, exploring the potential benefits of WD in other crops would be valuable.

**Paragraph 5**
In conclusion, this study demonstrates the efficacy of wood distillate (WD) in protecting basil plants against ozone damage by preserving membrane integrity and triggering antioxidant mechanisms. The results highlight the potential of using eco-friendly alternatives like WD to mitigate the negative effects of O3-induced oxidative stress on crop yields. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanism of action of WD and its applicability to other crops and environmental stresses.
