Abstract: In order to quantitatively reveal the differential effects of O3 precursors on O3 production in urban and suburban areas, the multi-scale characteristics of NO<sub>2</sub>-O<sub>3</sub> intercorrelation at different sites in urban and suburban areas of 15 key cities in Sichuan Province from 2016 to 2022 were compared based on the multiple fractal detrended correlation analysis and K-means clustering algorithm. The results show that the atmospheric NO<sub>2</sub>-O<sub>3</sub> intercorrelations in urban and suburban areas are characterized by multi-fractality and long-term persistence, and the intensity of multi-fractality at suburban sites is significantly higher than that in urban areas. The differences in the NO<sub>2</sub>-O<sub>3</sub> correlations between urban and suburban areas showed a yearly increasing pattern, and were affected by the seasons, with the largest differences between urban and suburban areas in summer and the smallest ones in winter, which were mainly influenced by the emission characteristics of O<sub>3</sub> precursors and the heat is land effect. The study of NO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> inter-correlation multiple fractal variation patterns provides a new perspective to understand the differences in the characteristics and formation mechanisms of air pollution in urban and suburban areas, and provides new parameters for the improvement of the refined prediction model of O<sub>3</sub> in urban and suburban areas.
