The increasing number of orbital spacecraft has raised concerns about their impact on the environment, particularly ozone depletion. As space exploration and commercialization continue to grow, it is essential to establish a regulatory framework for emissions generated by orbital spacecraft within the scope of international law. This study aims to analyze the formation of international agreements to address the crisis caused by ozone depletion due to emissions from orbital spacecraft.
