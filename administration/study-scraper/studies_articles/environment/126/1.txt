This study employed LCA to comprehensively assess the environmental impacts of utilizing reclaimed water in a hydroponic system. The methodology involved identifying the key contributors to the hydroponic system's environmental burden, including water, substrates, fertilizers, and energy sources. Reclaimed water was compared to conventional water across various indicators, such as climate change, fine particulate matter formation, and freshwater consumption.
