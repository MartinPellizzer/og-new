Here is a summary of the study in one paragraph, focusing on the information and data related to ozone:

Researchers investigated the effect of direct and indirect pre-oxidation using ozone gas on gold extraction from refractory ore in a cyanidation process. Ozone gas was generated using air and O2 as raw materials at different pH levels. Results showed that increasing pre-oxidation time maintained at pH 2, with pure O2 as the ozone source, led to increased dissolution of Cu, Fe, and Zn. Direct pre-oxidation using air as the ozone source at pH 2 improved gold extraction from 79.08% to 82.78% in the cyanidation process. The study highlights the potential of ozone gas pre-oxidation as a pretreatment method for improving gold recovery from refractory ores, with optimal conditions being pH 2 and using pure O2 as the ozone raw material.
