Here are five detailed paragraphs based on the scientific study:

**Paragraph 1: Introduction**
The postharvest phase of date fruits is critical in maintaining their quality and preventing spoilage. Ethyl formate has been identified as a promising fumigant due to its potential antimicrobial and insecticidal properties. The present study aimed to investigate the in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activity of ethyl formate against bacteria and fungi commonly found on date fruits. The study focused on two common date fruit varieties, semi-dry El-Wady I and dry Frehi, and evaluated the effectiveness of ethyl formate as a natural alternative to control microbial contamination.

**Paragraph 2: Methods**
The in vitro antimicrobial efficacy of ethyl formate was tested against three microbial species: Aspergillus niger F4, Mucor circinelloides YMM22, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa B1. Ethyl formate concentrations ranged from 0 to 10 mg/L, and the inhibitory activity was assessed using filter paper discs. The in vivo efficacy of ethyl formate was evaluated on date fruits by fumigation with a promising concentration of 70 mg/L air for 24 h. Microbial loads were determined by serial dilution and pour plate technique.

**Paragraph 3: Results**
The results showed that ethyl formate significantly reduced the number of viable bacteria and fungi on date fruits. The percentages of reduction in fungal count were 78.18 and 90.76% for Frehi and El-Wady I varieties, respectively, while bacterial counts decreased by 53.31 and 65.20%, respectively. In vitro testing revealed that ethyl formate exhibited antimicrobial activity against all three microbial species, with an EC50 value of 2.5 mg/L.

**Paragraph 4: Discussion**
The findings suggest that ethyl formate is a promising natural alternative for controlling microbial contamination on date fruits. The results are consistent with previous studies demonstrating the antimicrobial properties of ethyl formate. However, further research is needed to investigate the optimal fumigation duration and concentration for comprehensive control of microbial pathogens.

**Paragraph 5: Conclusion**
In conclusion, this study demonstrated the in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activity of ethyl formate against bacteria and fungi on date fruits. The results support the potential use of ethyl formate as a natural alternative to conventional fumigants. Future studies should focus on optimizing the fumigation conditions to achieve comprehensive control of microbial pathogens and ensure environmental sustainability.
