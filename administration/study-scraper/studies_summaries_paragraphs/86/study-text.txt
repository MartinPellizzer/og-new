Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the study, focusing on the data related to ozone:

The study investigated factors contributing to differences in air pollutants between metropolitan areas in the US using EPA daily fine particulate matter (PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and ozone (O3) pollutant concentrations from seven regions across the country for 2018-2022. A strong positive correlation was observed between O3 and temperature, suggesting that warmer temperatures are associated with increased ozone levels. This correlation was consistent across all regions, indicating a widespread impact of temperature on ozone concentrations. Additionally, the study found a weak correlation between precipitation and all pollutants, and a negative correlation between wind speed and NO2. These findings highlight the significance of considering natural processes, such as temperature and weather patterns, in understanding differences in air pollutant concentrations between metropolitan areas.
