The results showed that wind turbines had the highest impacts on climate change (1.45E+11 kg CO2 eq), acidification potential (3.82E+08 mol H+ eq), and eutrophication potential (6.56E+04 kg P eq). In contrast, PEM electrolyzers had the highest impact in the ozone depletion category (24.87 kg CFC11 eq). Interestingly, the lowest environmental impacts were observed for the wind turbines in all categories except ozone depletion, where the PEM electrolyzer had a slightly lower impact.
