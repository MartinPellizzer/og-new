Here is a detailed summary of the study in 1 paragraph (60-80 words), focusing on ozone-related information:

A high-resolution modeling study reveals that urban greening can exacerbate ozone pollution in Guangzhou, China. The study found that biogenic volatile organic compound emissions from urban green spaces contributed approximately 30% to urban isoprene concentrations and increased monthly mean ozone levels by 2.2-3.0 µg/m³ (2.3-3.2%) in urban areas during pollution episodes. These impacts can extend to surrounding regions through regional transport, highlighting the need for selecting low-emission vegetation and refining vegetation classification in urban planning to mitigate ozone pollution.
