The Photochemical Ozone Creation Potential (POCP) is an important method for quantifying the ozone formation potential of VOCs. This method involves calculating the incremental reactivity of a VOC towards OH radicals, which then allows for the estimation of the amount of ozone formed by that VOC. In this study, POCP was compared with alternate methods such as Maximum Incremental Reactivity (MIR) and Propene-Equivalent O3 formation weightings.
