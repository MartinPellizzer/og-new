Air pollution is a significant environmental issue in urban areas, particularly in cities like Tehran, where rapid urbanization and industrialization have led to an increase in pollutants. The city's land use pattern plays a crucial role in determining the distribution of pollutants, with certain activities such as industry and traffic contributing more than others to air pollution. This study aims to investigate the effect of land use patterns on air pollution in the western area of Tehran, with a focus on creating health buffers around sensitive uses like schools, hospitals, and residential areas.
