The findings of this meta-analysis suggest that ozone therapy may be a useful adjunct treatment for DFUs, particularly in expediting wound healing and reducing hospital length of stay. However, the heterogeneity among studies and potential biases in study design and outcome measurements need to be addressed through further research. Additionally, the optimal dosage and duration of ozone therapy remain unclear and require further investigation.
