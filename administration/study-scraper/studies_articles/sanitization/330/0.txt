Waterborne pathogens pose a significant threat to public health. Understanding how bacteria respond to disinfection technologies is crucial for developing effective treatment strategies. Quorum sensing (QS) is a system that allows bacteria to coordinate their growth and metabolism. However, the regulatory mechanisms of QS in response to various disinfection technologies remain unclear. This study investigates the inactivation effect of chlorination and ozonation on biofilms and planktonic cells of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a bacterium known for its ability to form biofilms and resist disinfection.
