The findings of this study provide evidence that short-term exposure to wildfire-related O3 pollution is associated with increased risk of all-cause, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality globally. The results suggest that effective risk and smoke management strategies should be implemented to protect the public from the impacts of wildfires. Further research is needed to investigate the potential long-term effects of wildfire-related O3 exposure on human health.
