Here are the five detailed paragraphs based on the scientific study:

**Paragraph 1: Introduction**
The commercial equipment used in supermarkets is a significant contributor to energy consumption and environmental impact. The Montreal Protocol and Kigali Amendment aim to reduce the depletion of the ozone layer and combat climate change by phasing out hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and regulating the use of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). With over 110,000 supermarkets in Europe and 65,000-70,000 in China, there is a pressing need to modernize refrigeration equipment to ensure environmental sustainability. This study investigates the potential for increasing energy efficiency and reducing environmental impact by analyzing refrigerants used in supermarket commercial equipment.

**Paragraph 2: Methods**
The study compared the energy efficiency ratio (EER) and coefficient of performance (COP) of traditional refrigerants R404a, R449a, and R502 with a mixture of hydrocarbons (R290: 85 %, R600a: 15 %). The tests were conducted at evaporation temperatures of T<sub>evap</sub>=–10 °C and –25 °C. The results were analyzed to determine the advantages and disadvantages of each refrigerant in terms of energy efficiency.

**Paragraph 3: Results**
The study found that the hydrocarbon mixture showed significant improvements in EER and COP compared to traditional refrigerants. At T<sub>evap</sub>=–10 °C, the EER increased by 38-44 % and COP by 26-31 % compared to R404a and R449a. At T<sub>evap</sub>=–25 °C, the EER increased by 17-34 % and COP by 2-22 % compared to R404a and R449a. Compared to R502, the hydrocarbon blend showed a 38-44 % increase in EER and 28-31 % COP at T<sub>evap</sub>=–10 °C, and a 17-34 % increase in EER and 5-22 % COP at T<sub>evap</sub>=–25 °C.

**Paragraph 4: Discussion**
The results of the study highlight the advantages of using hydrocarbon mixtures as refrigerants in commercial equipment. The significant improvements in EER and COP indicate that these blends can reduce energy consumption and environmental impact. Additionally, the mixture meets safety regulations, making it a viable option for widespread application. The findings suggest that supermarkets should consider upgrading their refrigeration equipment to take advantage of the benefits offered by hydrocarbon mixtures.

**Paragraph 5: Conclusions**
In conclusion, this study demonstrates the potential of hydrocarbon mixtures as refrigerants in commercial supermarket equipment. The results show significant improvements in energy efficiency and reduced environmental impact compared to traditional refrigerants. With global efforts aimed at reducing ozone depletion and combating climate change, the use of hydrocarbon mixtures can contribute to a more sustainable future for supermarkets and the environment.
