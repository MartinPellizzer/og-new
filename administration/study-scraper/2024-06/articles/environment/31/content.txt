Here are five detailed paragraphs using the information and data from the scientific study:

**Paragraph 1: Introduction**
Tropospheric ozone is a significant air pollutant and greenhouse gas that poses a threat to human health and the environment. Understanding its variability in different regions is crucial for effective pollution mitigation strategies. This study focuses on evaluating the diurnal, seasonal, and interannual variations in tropospheric ozone content near the Gulf of Finland, with a focus on St. Petersburg (Russia) and Helsinki (Finland). The study uses a 3D numerical model of atmospheric composition, WRF-Chem, to simulate the tropospheric ozone variability and validate it against complex observational data.

**Paragraph 2: Methods**
The WRF-Chem model is used with a spatial resolution of 10 km for the 2016-2019 period. The modeling domain covers an area of 960 × 960 km², centered at St. Petersburg, and includes western Russia, southern Finland, Estonia, Latvia, the Gulf of Finland, and the Baltic Sea. The model uses ERA5 reanalysis data as meteorological boundary conditions and CAM-Chem chemical transport model data as chemical initial and boundary conditions. Anthropogenic emissions are set using the EDGARv5.0 global inventory.

**Paragraph 3: Results**
The study reveals that the diurnal cycle of near-surface ozone concentrations in both cities is caused by variations in NO2 emissions, planetary boundary layer height, and local meteorological conditions. Seasonal variations in near-surface ozone concentrations and tropospheric ozone content are caused by changes in total ozone content and ozone formation in the troposphere. The model also identifies a VOC-limited regime in the 0-1 km layer around St. Petersburg, Helsinki, and the Gulf of Finland, and a NOx-limited regime in the 0-2 km layer in forests of southern Finland, Karelia, some Russian regions, and Baltic countries.

**Paragraph 4: Discussion**
The study highlights the importance of considering local meteorological conditions and emissions in simulating tropospheric ozone variability. The overestimation of measured near-surface ozone concentrations by the WRF-Chem model suggests that errors in chemical boundary conditions and emissions of ozone precursors are significant sources of uncertainty. The coarse spatial resolution of the modeling also contributes to these differences.

**Paragraph 5: Conclusions**
In conclusion, this study demonstrates the potential of using a 3D numerical model of atmospheric composition, WRF-Chem, to evaluate tropospheric ozone variability near the Gulf of Finland. The results suggest that local meteorological conditions and emissions play a crucial role in determining tropospheric ozone concentrations. The findings highlight the need for more detailed and accurate emissions inventories and boundary conditions to improve the accuracy of air quality simulations. This study provides valuable insights into the spatial and temporal variations of tropospheric ozone near urban areas, which can inform effective pollution mitigation strategies.
