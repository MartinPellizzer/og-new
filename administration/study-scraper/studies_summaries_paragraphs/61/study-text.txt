Here is a detailed summary of the study in 1 paragraph, focusing on the info and data related to ozone:

The study fabricated MOF-carbonized materials as ozone catalysts for water purification, synthesizing three Me-MOF-C materials (Me: Fe, Cu, and Zn). When combined with ozone, all Me-MOF-C promoted target removal, with Fe-MOF-C exhibiting optimal ozone utilization efficiency. ROS quantification showed that the •OH in the Fe-MOF-C/O3 system was approximately 48.0 times higher than the single ozone system, achieving over 90% target removal through •OH generation. The catalytic mechanism investigation revealed that H2O2 and surface-adsorbed Fe2+ played crucial roles, with Fe2+ likely converting H2O2 into HO2ˉ, which then decomposed ozone to produce •OH more efficiently.
