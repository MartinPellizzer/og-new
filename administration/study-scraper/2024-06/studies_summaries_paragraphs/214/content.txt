Here is a summary of the study in 1 detailed paragraph focusing on ozone-related information:

Researchers investigated the removal of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and membrane fouling control in leather industry secondary effluent treated with different ozone-based advanced oxidation processes (O3-AOPs). The O3/UV, O3/H2O2, and O3/UV/H2O2 processes achieved effective DOM removal, resulting in a reduction of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from 14.0 mg/L to 6.8, 7.7, and 8.8 mg/L, respectively. Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) revealed that O3/UV facilitated the removal of aromatic and protein-like compounds, enhancing oxygen content in the effluent and alleviating membrane fouling. The study demonstrated that each O3-AOP had a unique mechanism for DOM transformation and membrane fouling control, highlighting the importance of understanding these processes to optimize wastewater treatment and membrane filtration water regeneration.
