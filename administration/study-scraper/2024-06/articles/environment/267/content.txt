Here are five detailed paragraphs based on the scientific study:

**Paragraph 1: Introduction**
Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) play a crucial role in the formation of ground-level ozone, which can have negative impacts on air quality and human health. The Taiyuan Basin is a significant VOC-emitting region in China, with Jinzhong being one of the major cities within it. To better understand the characteristics, sources, and potential source regions of VOCs in this region, researchers conducted a three-year monitoring study from 2020 to 2022.

**Paragraph 2: Methods**
The researchers used a real-time online instrument to monitor VOCs at a site in Jinzhong, Taiyuan Basin, from April to September each year. They analyzed the data using positive matrix factorization (PMF) model and meteorological normalization to identify the sources of VOCs. Additionally, they calculated the ozone formation potential (OFP) of different VOC groups and compounds.

**Paragraph 3: Results**
The results showed that the interannual variation in VOCs concentration increased from 11.2 ± 8.2 ppbv in 2020 to 12.9 ± 9.2 ppbv in 2021 and 13.3 ± 8.9 ppbv in 2022. Alkanes were the major VOC groups, accounting for 55.8-64.6% of the total, while alkenes contributed the most to OFP, ranging from 64.3-74.2%. After meteorological normalization, the concentrations of alkanes, alkynes, and aromatics were slightly higher than the observed concentrations.

**Paragraph 4: Discussion**
The study highlights the importance of controlling coking sources and vehicular emissions, particularly ethylene emissions, to mitigate ozone issues in Jinzhong and downwind areas. The results also suggest that regional transport plays a significant role in VOC emissions and OFP in the Taiyuan Basin. Moreover, the analysis pointed to the southwest region (Qingxu, Wenshui, Xiaoyi, and Jiexiu) as a key emitter of VOCs.

**Paragraph 5: Conclusion**
In conclusion, this study provides valuable insights into the characteristics, sources, and potential source regions of VOCs in the Taiyuan Basin. The findings recommend effective mitigation strategies for ozone issues by controlling coking sources and vehicular emissions. Furthermore, the study highlights the importance of considering regional transport and source apportionment to develop targeted emission reduction measures.
