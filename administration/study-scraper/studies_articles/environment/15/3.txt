The findings suggest that geophysical variations can influence the development and spread of pandemics. The relationship between solar activity and geomagnetic indices may play a crucial role in fostering favorable conditions for pandemics. Additionally, the study highlights the importance of considering planetary boundaries, such as ozone layer state and ultraviolet radiation, when investigating global health phenomena.
