The results of this study provide valuable insights into the effects of defects on the optical and electrical properties of TMDCs. The findings demonstrate that UV-O3 exposure can be used to modify the surface properties of TMDCs, leading to changes in their electronic and optical behavior. These modifications have important implications for the development of TMDC-based devices with improved performance.
