Abstract
Ozone at the concentration of 0.04 mL L–1 appears to have potential for extending the storage life of broccoli and seedless cucumbers stored at 3°C. Response to ozone was minimal for mushrooms stored at 4°C and cucumbers stored at 10°C. Ozone generators producing 0.04 mL L–1 ozone reduced the ethylene level in vegetable storage rooms from 1.5–2 mL L–1 (as produced by apples placed in the room) to a non-detectable level. At concentrations of 0.4 mL L–1, ozone was effective in removing ethylene from the atmosphere in an apple and pear storage room. The ozonized and non-ozonized apples and pears showed no difference in fruit quality. This study explored a potential use of ozone application in wholesale storage rooms where ethylene-producing and ethylene-sensitive fruits and vegetables may be stored together. Key words: Ozone, ethylene, fruit, vegetable, apple, pear, broccoli, cucumber, mushroom, storage
