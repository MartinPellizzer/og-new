The study retrospectively examined 523 revision rhinoplasty patients operated by a single surgeon from January 2017 to January 2024. Patients who consented to ozone therapy received three major autohemotherapy sessions post-surgery. The patients were divided into two groups: those with compromised nasal skin (n=12) and those with normal healing (n=511). Demographic data, including age, gender, smoking status, diabetes, previous surgeries, grafting materials, and techniques, were recorded.
