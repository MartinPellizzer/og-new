Impact of weather patterns and meteorological factors on PM2.5 and O3 responses to the COVID-19 lockdown in China
Fuzhen Shen, Michaela I. Hegglin, and Yue Yuan
Abstract
Haze events in the North China Plain (NCP) and a decline in ozone levels in Southern Coast China (SC) from 21 January to 9 February 2020 during the COVID-19 lockdown have attracted public curiosity and scholarly attention. Most previous studies focused on the impact of atmospheric chemistry processes associated with anomalous weather elements in these cases, but fewer studies quantified the impact of various weather elements within the context of a specific weather pattern. To identify the weather patterns responsible for inducing this unexpected situation and to further quantify the importance of different meteorological factors during the haze event, two approaches are employed. These approaches implemented the comparisons of observations in 2020 with climatology averaged over the years 2015–2019 with a novel structural SOM (self-organising map) model and with the prediction of the “business as usual” (hereafter referred to as BAU) emission strength by the GBM (gradient-boosting machine) model, respectively. The results reveal that the unexpected PM2.5 pollution and O3 decline from the climatology in NCP and SC could be effectively explained by the presence of a double-centre high-pressure system across China. Moreover, the GBM results provided a quantitative assessment of the importance of each meteorological factor in driving the predictions of PM2.5 and O3 under the specific weather system. These results indicate that temperature played the most crucial role in the haze event in NCP, as well as in the O3 change in SC. This valuable information will ultimately contribute to our ability to predict air pollution under future emission scenarios and changing weather patterns that may be influenced by climate change.

1 Introduction
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has lasted for 4.5 years and has led to over 7 million deaths globally as of June 2023 (WHO, 2024). The Chinese government implemented strict lockdown measures nationwide during the first 2 months of 2020 to curb the spread of this pandemic (Le et al., 2020), which led to significant reductions in anthropogenic emissions, especially in the transportation sector (Xu et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2021). As a result, a decline not only in NO2 but also in PM2.5, PM10, SO2, and CO concentrations on a national scale was indicated by both satellite and ground-based measurements, although with the negative consequence of enhancements in O3 concentrations (Shen et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2021; He et al., 2020). Contrary to the situation in other regions from 21 January to 9 February 2020, Northern China (NC) and Southwestern China (SWC) experienced severe haze pollution and decreased O3 situations, respectively (Le et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2020). This exceptional situation during the haze event in China thus lends itself to a large-scale “experiment” to study the unusual phenomenon driven by atmospheric chemistry and meteorology.
PM2.5 and ground-level ozone (O3), especially in highly polluted regions, adversely affect human health (Lelieveld et al., 2015), agriculture (Feng et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2007), and the Earth's radiation budget (Liao et al., 2015; Dang and Liao, 2019), thereby leading to premature mortality, decreases in crop yields, and altering the climate. Anthropogenic PM2.5, in addition to being generated by fossil fuels and biomass burning, is also produced through the reactions of inorganics (e.g. NO, NO2, SO2, and NH3) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) (Zheng et al., 2017). In contrast, O3 is not directly emitted but is formed through a series of photochemical reactions involving multiple precursors (e.g. carbon monoxide (CO), methane (CH4), VOCs, NO, and NO2) (Ge et al., 2013). Apart from intense local primary emissions and secondary chemical formation, stagnant meteorological conditions and regional transport are two additional contributors to severe haze and O3 pollution events (Shen et al., 2020). Recently, a series of air quality regulations (Clean Air Plans, CAPs) released by the Chinese government have resulted in a notable decrease in anthropogenic emissions, leading to a substantial improvement in air quality due to reductions in PM2.5 concentrations but a nationwide enhancement of O3 pollution in China (Shen et al., 2020; K. Li et al., 2019). It is known that the impacts of meteorological conditions and atmospheric chemical processes could result in non-linear responses of PM2.5 and O3 to the decreases in their precursor concentrations (H. Li et al., 2019; Li et al., 2020). However, the specific responses of air pollutants and atmospheric chemistry to emissions and meteorological conditions have not been clearly determined.
For the haze event in China introduced above, recent studies on the topic suggested that complex atmospheric chemistry processes triggered by emission reductions and meteorological conditions are responsible for the unexpected haze formation regionally during the COVID-19 lockdown (Le et al., 2020; Fu et al., 2021). In detail, the substantial decrease in NO2 emissions during the COVID-19 lockdown resulted in an increase in O3 levels and nighttime NO3 radical formation, enhancing the atmospheric oxidation capacity (AOC) and facilitating the formation of secondary aerosols. Additionally, the presence of anomalous relative humidity promoted heterogeneous chemistry processes (Le et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2021; Ma et al., 2022). After the formation, more generated secondary aerosols were transported toward the in situ measurement station in northern China (Lv et al., 2020). Meanwhile, some research pointed out that the high ambient humidity is also the key to the NC haze from the perspective of adjusting pH to control the formation efficiency of nitrate aerosol, which is one of the major species for NC haze (Chang et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2020). In addition to the influence of changes in chemical reactions, a physical mechanism known as the aerosol–planetary boundary layer (PBL) interaction is also considered to have had a significant impact on the haze formation (Su et al., 2020). For O3, the decline in climatology in SC was attributable to the weakened photochemistry reactions due to the emission reductions in and the dilution effect of the clean air masses on the mass loadings of NOx and VOC (Fu et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2021). Overall, meteorological conditions always played a critical role; high relative humidity is the trigger of aerosol heterogeneous chemistry by adjusting the particle pH or providing a reaction medium. Meanwhile, the transport of the secondary aerosol or clean air masses and shallow PBL height are primarily driven by wind and pressure, respectively. Importantly, the above weather elements are modulated synergistically by synoptic-scale weather patterns (SWPs) or large-scale atmospheric circulations.
Numerous studies have been conducted worldwide to explore the direct connections between SWPs and air quality fields (Dayan and Levy, 2002; Demuzere et al., 2009; Pope et al., 2015; Hegarty et al., 2007; Bei et al., 2016; Jiang et al., 2017), indicating that good air quality conditions are often observed under cyclonic weather systems with certain types and positions, while poor air quality is frequently associated with anticyclonic conditions. However, the relationship between air quality and SWPs can differ depending on location, time, and pollutants (Jiang et al., 2017; Liao et al., 2017). The classification methods for SWPs employed in these studies can generally be categorised into the following three groups: subjective (manual), mixed (hybrid), and objective (automated) (Huth et al., 2008). Objective classification methods for SWPs are known for their speed, objectivity, and high reproducibility, often achieving classification 100 % automatically. On the other hand, manual approaches for SWPs have the advantage of allowing the user to control the selection of representative weather types (Lewis and Keim, 2015). Hybrid classification combines the strengths of both manual and automated techniques, where the users define the classification types, but the classification process itself is performed automatically (Frakes and Yarnal, 1997; Lewis and Keim, 2015; Huth et al., 2008). At present, the subjective method was used to investigate the contribution of six SWPs to PM2.5 pollution in Northwest China (Bei et al., 2016). While subjective approaches are suitable for analysing short time series, they have significant limitations when applied to large datasets spanning extended periods of time (Chen et al., 2022). Hybrid classification for SWPs is more popular than the subjective one and was applied to explore the impact of SWPs on O3, PM2.5 and CO in the North China Plain (NCP), Yangtze River Delta (YRD), and Eastern China, respectively (Zhang et al., 2013, 2016; Han et al., 2018; Liao et al., 2017). As an objective classification and with its advantages, the self-organising map (SOM) algorithm has been used to identify the impact of different SWPs on O3 and PM2.5 in the YRD and Sichuan Basin (SCB), respectively (Shu et al., 2020; Zhan et al., 2019). In addition, the principle component analysis T mode, k-means clustering, and other clustering approaches (like the Lamb–Jenkinson method) also were adopted to quantify the impact of SWPs on O3 in NCP (Miao et al., 2017; Dong et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2019).
Based on the studies mentioned above, previous research on the drivers for unusual haze and O3 decline events has concentrated on the influence of atmospheric chemistry processes accompanied by the anomaly of one or two weather elements but has not yet focused on the impact of weather elements in a comprehensive and synergistic way. Therefore, we here investigate the effect of anomalies in weather conditions with respect to climatology on PM2.5 and O3 concentrations during the haze event in the COVID-19 lockdown, specifically. To this end, we apply a novel SOM algorithm called structural SOM (S-SOM) to identify the most meaningful clustering number of weather patterns and compare it to other traditional SOM methods including ED-SOM and the SOM algorithm based on the Pearson correlation coefficient (hereafter named COR-SOM). Furthermore, after determining the weather patterns, we evaluate the contribution of SWPs to PM2.5 and O3 changes during the COVID-19 lockdown in China. Last, to better understand what role each meteorological factor played in the PM2.5 and O3 pollution during this period, the SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) approach is used to evaluate their relative importance for the predictions of the machine learning (ML) model. The knowledge gained will ultimately help to predict air pollution under future emission scenarios and weather patterns potentially altered by climate change.

2.1 Observational and model dataset sources
The hourly observation dataset during the first 2 months (January and February) from 2015 to 2020, including two air pollutants (PM2.5 and O3) and six meteorological factors (pressure is P, precipitation is Precip, temperature is Temp, relative humidity is RH, wind speed is WS, wind direction is WD), was divided into two parts, namely the training dataset and test dataset, which were used to build a prediction model based on machine learning. Air pollutant and meteorological station datasets were downloaded from the National Environmental Monitoring Centre (http://www.cnemc.cn, last access: 28 May 2024) and the National Meteorological Science Data Center repository (https://data.cma.cn, last access: 28 May 2024). To better understand the climatological behaviour of air pollutants, 367 surface measurement stations across China are divided into eight different regions (including NCP for North China Plain, IM for Inner Mongolia, NEC for North Eastern China, YRD for Yangtze River Delta, CS for Central South, SC for Southern Coast, TP for Tibet Plateau, and NWC for North Western China) based on different typical climate characteristics (see the climate classification scheme at https://www.resdc.cn/data.aspx?DATAID=243, last access: 28 May 2024; Fig. 1). In addition, hourly surface ERA5 data with 0.25 × 0.25 spatial resolution, including mean sea level pressure (MSLP) (at 14:00 local time per day) and total solar
