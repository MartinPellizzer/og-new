The research employed a combination of UV-O3 exposure and FIB techniques to modify the surface properties of suspended and flat 2D TMDCs. High-quality crystals were grown using molecular beam epitaxy, and their surfaces were modified through UV-O3 exposure. The FIB technique was used to create defects on the crystal surfaces. The optical and electrical properties of the modified materials were then investigated using a range of techniques, including Raman spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, and electrical conductivity measurements.
