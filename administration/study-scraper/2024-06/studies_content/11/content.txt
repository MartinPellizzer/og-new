What’s happening in the Arctic sky?
Posted on 15 February, 2016 by Stephen Burt
By Michaela Hegglin
Meteorologists may say clouds are all about weather, but they sure aren’t, or at least not all of them! This late winter, people watching the sky in northern England witnessed spectacular appearances of nacreous clouds, also referred to as mother-of-pearl clouds (see Figure 1). Nacreous/mother-of-pearl is used to describe the inner, hard, and iridescent layer of certain seashells, and that is exactly how nacreous clouds in the sky look – shining like pearls. The more technical name is polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs), which tells us where these clouds can be found. PSCs are located in the polar stratosphere at altitudes between 15 and 25 km. They become visible to the human eye when the Sun is below the horizon, with sunlight being reflected from the clouds at very low angles. PSCs form at very low temperatures (below -78° C), encountered in the polar stratosphere only during winter. The main reason they occur at such low temperatures is the very small water vapour concentrations in the air (only 5 out of 1 million air molecules are water molecules). Despite their beauty, however, PSCs have a nasty side to them — they can severely enhance stratospheric ozone loss. This is the reason for the Antarctic ozone hole.

Chemically, there are two different types of PSCs. Type I PSCs form at temperatures below -78° C and consist of nitric acid trihydrate (NAT = [HNO3•3*H­2O]) particles. Type II PSCs form at even lower temperatures (below -85° C) and consist of pure water-ice crystals (H2O). The formation rate is also dependent on the availability of condensation nuclei such as liquid sulphuric aerosol or meteoritic material. Volcanic eruptions that lead to the injection of sulphur oxides into the lower stratosphere for example can strongly enhance the availability of such condensation nuclei and hence the formation of PSCs. Because temperatures in the southern hemisphere polar winter stratosphere are generally lower than in the northern hemisphere, PSCs occur more extensively in the southern hemisphere. This northern hemisphere winter has, however, seen temperatures much below the PSC-type I formation threshold value from early December through January, extending over an area of more than 15 million square kilometres at times (see Figure 2).
  Figure 2: (upper) 50°N-90°N Arctic minimum temperature at 50 hPa averaged over 1979-2014 (light grey) with 70% and 90% percentiles highlighted in light and dark turquoise. Coloured lines show different years, with red being the winter of 2015/16. (lower) Integrated area where PSC formation is possible in the Northern Hemisphere. Here the average is in blue, the 2015/16 winter in orange. (WMO Bulletin, 2016)
It’s on the surface of PSCs that chemical reactions occur in which reservoir species of chlorine (such as HCl and ClONO2, which are not reactive enough to be involved in ozone depletion) are converted into Cl2. In spring, with the help of sunlight, Cl2 is split into single reactive chlorine atoms (Cl). Cl is involved in the catalytic cycles that lead to efficient ozone destruction, with one Cl atom being estimated to destroy up to 100,000 ozone molecules over its lifetime (see Figure 3).
Figure 3: Catalytic cycle of chlorine (Cl) that leads to ozone (O3) destruction. In a first step, a chlorine atom reacts with O3, forming a chlorine monoxide (ClO) and an oxygen molecule (O2). In a second step, the ClO reacts with an oxygen atom (O), regenerating the Cl and thereby starting the cycle anew. (Hegglin et al., WMO 2015)
Given the large area in the polar stratosphere over which PSC-formation temperatures have been recorded this year, and extensive observations of PSCs in the Northern sky, the big question for stratospheric ozone scientists now is, will we experience a record-ozone hole over the Arctic once the sunlight returns in spring?
The question has no definitive answer as yet, which is why a whole army of scientists is currently in the polar circle with their instruments ready to measure ozone depletion, while others are eagerly studying meteorological forecasts. The key ingredient to the development of severe ozone loss is in fact meteorology. It will be crucial that the air masses that experienced activation of Cl2 remain isolated from mid-latitude air until they see sunlight that will form Cl and start the catalytic destruction cycle seen in Figure 3. If mid-latitude air is mixed into the polar regions too early then the chlorine atoms can get deactivated by reactions involving nitrogen oxides (NOx) or hydrogen oxides (HOx) before ozone destruction can take place. Continued isolation of the polar air masses will occur if the polar vortex (strong circumpolar winds delineating the area of low temperatures and high potential vorticity, see Figure 4) remains intact for another couple of weeks. While a stable vortex is currently still present (and some ozone depletion has already taken place), forecasters see some probability of rising temperatures and even a sudden stratospheric warming, which could lead to rapid decay of the vortex. Let’s keep our eyes on the sky!

Wrap up well for St Valentine’s Day – a good chance of snow!
Posted on 8 February, 2016 by Stephen Burt
By Roger Brugge
The days are getting longer, the nights are getting shorter, but the temperature keeps falling – and so does the snow. At least in the climatological statistics they do!
Looking at the date of occurrence of the lowest temperature of the year over the past 108 years in Reading (Figure 1) we find that the average date of the coldest night is 16 January (with the dates of 18 December to 14 February lying within one standard deviation of this date). The complete spread of dates is rather more than might be expected, from as early as 13 November (‑5.3 °C in 1921) to as late as 5 April (-3.3 °C in 1990).
Figure 1. A histogram of the date (day of the year) of the lowest temperature each year from 1908 to 2015 in Reading.
The year 1921 had seen a lack of low temperatures during the first three months of the year (down to -3.1 °C in January, but then came three air frosts and three days with snowfall in mid‑April) while in 1990 there were four mornings with an air frost in April – a monthly total only surpassed that year by December (9 mornings).
Thus, in terms of the lowest temperature of the year, the first week of February (days 32-38) is beginning to show signs that the coldest night is past – but there can still be a sting in the tail of winter for gardeners.
What does the average daily temperature tell us? Defined as average of the highest and lowest temperatures of the day, the evolution of this by day during winter and spring is shown in Figure 2.
Figure 2. Daily mean temperature in Reading averaged over 1981-2010, from 1 November to 30 April.
This shows a notable dip around mid-February, with the 14th being (on average) the coldest day of the winter, and the only day in the year when the mean minimum temperature in Reading falls below the critical 0°C mark. What does that say about St Valentine’s Day?
Moreover there is also a peak in the incidence of snowfall at this time of year – snow or sleet fell eight times in the 30 years 1981-2010 on 8 February, with seven occurrences on the 9th. Statistically, this makes 8 February the most like day of the year to experience snowfall in Reading while 9 February is as likely to see snowfall as 7 January. Perhaps not surprisingly, 9 February is the morning most likely of any during the year to have snow cover on the ground at 0900 GMT.
So don’t put those sledges back in the loft just yet!
And finally …

The driving mechanism of large-scale unsteady currents in the ocean
Posted on 1 February, 2016 by Stephen Burt
By Antoine Hochet
During the last twenty years, measurements of the ocean surface properties by satellite instruments have significantly increased our knowledge of ocean dynamics.
One of these instruments is an altimeter that measures the topography of the ocean surface with a resolution of a quarter of degree. This surface topography can be decomposed into two fields: a mean field independent of time, plus an anomaly field. The mean field is the signature of the mean oceanic circulation, such as the well-known Gulf Stream, but here we only focus on the anomalies. An example of what the anomaly field looks like  is shown in Figure 1. On this figure positive and negative anomalies are observed with very different spatial scales: some are large, others are small. The small scales, called mesoscales, range from 50 to 200 or 300 km and are associated with eddies whose driving mechanism is an instability of the mean currents. This is a remarkable property of geophysical fluids: under certain circumstances, the mean currents can spontaneously creates small scale anomalies.
Figure 1. Snapshot of sea surface height anomalies (in centimetres) on 14 October 1992
Here we are interested in larger scales, between 500 and 2000 km. At these scales, non-linearities that were previously very strong can now be neglected, currents behave linearly. It is generally agreed that the large-scale anomalies are observed in every oceanic basins and that their displacement velocity is directed to the west. One exception is in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current where the mean flow is so strong toward the east that the large scale anomalies move eastward as well. The dynamic of these large-scale anomalies is usually described as Rossby waves. Rossby waves owe their existence to the meridional variation of the Coriolis force which is itself the result of the sphericity and rotation of the Earth.
What are the driving mechanisms of these Rossby waves ?
The two main mechanisms that are usually used to explain Rossby waves formation are large-scale wind anomalies and propagating waves along eastern coasts. In fact, Rossby waves are the main response of the ocean to large-scale forcing, and as such, any process that introduces a large-scale perturbation in the ocean is likely to produce Rossby waves.
Here we ask ourselves if large-scale instability of the mean currents can create Rossby waves.
We saw above that instability of the mean currents mostly creates mesoscale anomalies with scales between 50 and 200 or 300 km. In fact instability creates anomalies at all scales but the growth is generally faster at small scales than at larger scales. However if the growth is faster at small scales it is not zero at large scales. Here we first investigate the rate of this large-scale growth as a function of the vertical structure of the mean currents and then calculate the growth rate of large-scale anomalies on in situ mean current data.
Results
Our results first show that the growth rate is very sensitive to the vertical structure of the zonal mean flow. Just as a sound can be decomposed into different sinusoidal components, we decompose the vertical structure of the mean zonal flow into different components, although this time not sinusoidal. We found that the largest growth happens when the component with two signs reversal on the vertical has a westward surface velocity.
Figure 2. Growth time (years) of the large-scale anomalies. White regions are regions with no data.
Figure 2 shows the growth rates in years of the large-scale anomalies calculated on real mean flow data extracted from a database constructed with ARGO float displacements. Growth rates smaller than a year are found in all oceanic basins at low latitudes  and in some regions of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Further comparison between the phase speed of the theoretical growing anomalies and the observed anomalies have shown that mean circulation is likely to produce large scale anomalies at low latitudes.
Our future calculations should include the horizontal variation of the mean flow.

Is it possible to predict inter-annual changes in terrestrial water storage at regional scales?
Posted on 18 January, 2016 by Stephen Burt
By Marie-Estelle Demory
Our results say yes! It is possible to predict changes in terrestrial water storage, when the signal that drives the changes is strong enough. Here is an explanation.
The hydrological cycle is a fundamental link between components of the Earth System: atmosphere, hydrosphere and biosphere. It is mainly driven by solar energy, is strongly influenced by the ocean, and involves complex interactive processes that drive the movement of water at various time and spatial scales. This complexity, together with a lack of homogeneous and accurate global observational datasets, compounds the difficulty climate modellers encounter in simulating the hydrological cycle with global climate models (GCM). This leads to large uncertainties in predictions of changes in the hydrological cycle.
Better prediction of the hydrological cycle variability and change, with particular relevance to water availability and security, is one of the main priorities of the Global Energy and Water Exchanges (GEWEX) for the next five to ten years (Trenberth and Asrar, 2014). GEWEX emphasises the importance of better exploiting available observations to confront models in new ways and improve our understanding of the processes associated with the hydrological cycle.
In line with this challenge, NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) launched in 2002 the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission, which has been measuring for the first time Earth’s gravity field variations and revealing key insights into Earth’s water storage and transport processes over land, ice and oceans. How does GRACE work? It consists of two satellites, and measures gravity by relating it to the distance between the two satellites. When there is an increase in gravity ahead of the pair, the front satellite speeds up and the distance between the pair increases. Once the front satellite has passed the area of increased gravity, it slows down while the back satellite speeds up, so that the distance between the pair decreases. Once the back satellite has passed the area of increased gravity, the distance between the pair increases and goes back to its original value. This technique permits to build monthly maps of the Earth’s average gravity field at a spatial resolution of about 300 km, like the one shown on Figure 1.
Figure 1. Earth’s gravity field anomalies (milligals) observed by GRACE. From http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov.
The variations in the Earth’s gravity field are tiny (less than 1%) but important and reveal changes in the Earth’s density from place to place and over time due to topography (e.g. mountains, valleys, deep ocean trenches), which we can easily locate on Fig. 1. Other variations, not as easily noticed, can also be observed due to changes in terrestrial water storage (TWS), ice sheets and sea level in a timescale from seasonal to decadal.
Due to its unique characteristic of being only based on mass, GRACE is a truly independent observational product. It is not connected to any techniques most other observational products use and that are also used to build GCMs (e.g. radiation, temperature). Its decade-long record from 2003 has revealed how inter-annual variations in terrestrial water storage are tied with the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) through transport of water vapour in the atmosphere from the oceans to the land (Boening et al, 2012).
In this study, we compare the GRACE data with GCM simulations with the aim to evaluate GCMs’ ability to import water over land on seasonal to decadal timescales, better understand the large-scale drivers of terrestrial water storage variability, and improve GCMs’ mid- to long-term prediction of floods and droughts, which threaten lives because of climate variability. Such an exercise has never been done before.
By analysing our 27 year ensemble simulations composed of 13 members (using the Met Office HadGEM3-GA3.0 atmospheric GCM), we were able to reproduce the variability in terrestrial water storage observed by GRACE caused by the fast and strong transition from El Niño to La Niña that occurred in 2010-11 (Figure 2).
Figure 2. Interannual variability in TWS anomaly over global land in GRACE (black), the model (blue), and the ERALand reanalyses (green). The thin black line shows the monthly mean data, the thick lines show a 3-month running average. The blue shading shows the model ensemble spread. Bottom: multivariate ENSO index. Blue (red) shading indicates La Niña (El Niño) events.
This 2010-11 transition is characterised by a very strong signal in sea surface temperature patterns to which the model responds very strongly. It simulates a large increase in TWS in Eastern Australia, South Africa, Brazil, Northwest United States, and a large decrease in Central Africa, Argentina, Southeast United States, in agreement with GRACE (Figure 3).
Figure 3. Composite map of TWS anomaly (in mm of water) during the 2010-11 transition event (MAM 2011 versus DJF 2010) in the model ensemble mean (left) and GRACE (right).
This indicates the ability of the model to simulate the large-scale processes involved in the atmospheric transport of water from the ocean to the land. In these regions, all the model ensemble members agree on the changes in TWS associated with this ENSO event, showing the skills of the model’s predictability in regions that are largely impacted by ENSO.
Assuming that the models were able to predict ENSO, this study shows that changes in terrestrial water storage could be predicted on a seasonal time scale for the regions that are largely impacted by ENSO (as also suggested by Figure 2, when comparing with the ERALand reanalyses). Such information would improve seasonal to decadal predictions of terrestrial water storage variability, which govern the long-term frequency of floods and droughts over the globe, and would be particularly beneficial in regions where humans are very vulnerable.
During weak-ENSO years and in regions not associated with ENSO, the agreement between the model and GRACE is less evident, and suggests the importance of other processes badly simulated or non-existent in GCMs (e.g. groundwater, irrigation), which need to be investigated. This promises new results that will be extremely useful for understanding the limits of middle-range weather to long-term climate predictions.
A PhD study following this work is currently being advertised.

Is climate change beneficial for North Africa?
Posted on 11 January, 2016 by Stephen Burt
by Buwen Dong
The Sahel, a band of semi-arid region south of the Sahara Desert that stretches from the Atlantic Ocean to the Red Sea, is one of Africa’s most productive crop regions. Mean annual rainfall in the region is on the order of 100 to 200 mm in the north and 500 to 600 mm at its southern limit, with about 90% of annual rainfall falling between July and September, associated with the West African Monsoon. The monsoon rainfall is fundamental for local agricultural production and economy. In the 1970s and 1980s a large part of North Africa suffered from persistent drought, which had devastating impacts on local populations. Between the 1950s and 1980s Sahelian summer rainfall declined by around 40%. Since then rainfall levels have recovered significantly, associated with a spatially coherent pattern of rainfall change across most of North Africa (Figure 1, see animation, Evan et al. 2015, Dong and Sutton 2015). The increase between the recent period 1996-2010 and the drought period 1964-1993 was 0.26 mm day-1, about one third of the decrease that occurred between the 1950s and the drought period.                       Figure 1. Observed changes in summer rainfall (mm day-1) in the Sahel region of North Africa (JAS = July-August-September). (a) Time series of Sahel rainfall (average over region indicated by red box in b), and (b) spatial pattern of difference between the recent period of 1996-2010 and the drought period of 1964-1993.
Since the drought, several potential drivers of Sahel rainfall have changed. Sea surface temperatures (SSTs) have warmed, particularly in the North Atlantic and Indian Oceans. Greenhouse gas concentrations have increased and there have been significant changes in anthropogenic aerosol precursor emissions, including a significant decline in sulphur dioxide emissions from Europe and North America and a significant increase from Asia. In order to understand the relative importance of these forcing factors on the recent Sahel rainfall recovery, numerical experiments with the atmospheric component of a state of the art global climate model have been performed in a study by Dong and Sutton (2015).
When all these three factors are changed, the model simulates an increase in Sahel rainfall of 0.23 mm day-1, similar to the observed change. The pattern of change (sum of Figure 2a and 2b) shows a coherent anomaly stretching across the Sahel, and is also similar to that observed. When individual forcing factors are changed separately we find, perhaps surprisingly, that the substantial changes in SST have almost no impact on Sahel rainfall (Figure 2a). Most of the signal – three quarters of the change in Sahel rainfall (Figure 2c) – is simulated in response to the increase in greenhouse gas forcing alone, the additional one quarter of the change being a response to the change in anthropogenic aerosol precursor emissions. Thus our results clearly indicate that greenhouse gas forcing has been the dominant factor in the recent recovery of Sahel rainfall. These results suggest that in the short term climate change has had some beneficial effects for this part of Africa. But this certainly doesn’t mean that the long term impacts will be beneficial.
Figure 2. Simulated changes in summer rainfall in the Sahel region of North Africa (JAS = July-August-September). (a) Response to changes in sea surface temperatures (SST), (b) Responses to the changes in greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations and anthropogenic aerosols (AA), and (c) responses to the changes in greenhouse gas concentrations alone. Thick lines highlight regions where the differences are statistically significant.
Looking forward to the next few decades, greenhouse gas concentrations will continue to rise. Our results suggest that this rise is favourable for sustaining, and potentially amplifying, the recovery of Sahel rainfall. It is also expected that anthropogenic aerosol precursor emissions will decline globally. Large regional variations in emissions mean the impact of this decline is hard to anticipate in detail, but our results suggest that the impact on Sahel rainfall may be less important than that caused by the sustained increase in greenhouse gases.

The recent Paris Climate talks and the global carbon cycle
Posted on 4 January, 2016 by Stephen Burt
By Tristan Quaife
The recent Paris Climate talks concluded with an agreement to “[hold] the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 degC above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degC above pre-industrial levels.” Expressing these targets in terms of temperatures is appealing as it is the change of temperature rather than change in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration per se that has a direct impact on us. But how do we know what levels of emissions of carbon dioxide (and other greenhouse gases) will keep us within these targets and, perhaps more importantly, how accurately do we know this?
The carbon cycle is one of the key players in global climate change. Sequestration of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere by the oceans and the land surface combined soaks up approximately 50% of anthropogenic emissions. Without this the rate of change of CO2 in the atmosphere would be nearly double and the rate of climate change significantly faster than it is today. What is particularly remarkable about this natural sequestration is that the proportion of carbon being sequestered has remained relatively constant over time despite increasing CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere. In other words the total amount being absorbed by the oceans and atmosphere has been increasing.
The processes that control the uptake of carbon by the land surface are very poorly understood. Indeed there remains some debate as to why the sequestration by the land surface has been able to keep pace with the increasing CO2 levels in the atmosphere. The most likely explanations for this are some combination of increased levels of nitrogen deposition from industrial processes (which allows plants to photosynthesise more), the simple availability of more CO2 for the plants to take up (so-called carbon fertilisation) and the regrowth of forests in regions where they had previously been cleared (primarily in northern latitudes). However we do not fully understand if these different elements will continue to function in the same way as the climate changes. Will the land surface continue absorb the same proportion of emissions or will it become a less strong sink? Some modelling studies even suggest the land surface could become a net source of carbon as the world warms, thus acting as an exacerbating feedback to climate change.
Just prior the Paris talks the Global Carbon Project released their annual budget describing the state of global carbon cycle. They conclude that to keep below 2 degC rise emissions will need to drop to near zero very soon. Figure 1, produced by the Global Carbon Project, shows the ensemble of emissions scenarios taken from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) with current global emissions superimposed. We are currently tracking near to the mean of the most aggressive of the scenarios that are predicted to give a change in temperature of a range 3.2 to 5.4 degC by the end of the century. It is important to realise, however, that for any given scenario there is still a considerable uncertainty in the resulting temperature change – and a large part of that uncertainty comes from our lack of understanding of the land surface.
The Paris climate agreement explicitly acknowledges the potential of “sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon.” This is undoubtedly an important component of any strategy to limit climate change. However if we want to understand the future, and thus be able to make well informed choices about emissions and mitigation, it is critical that we continue research into the carbon cycle and in particular the role of the land surface.
My group in the Department of Meteorology at the University of Reading are involved in numerous projects that seek to improve our understanding of the global carbon cycle. In the MELODIES project our role is the production of new land cover data sets optimised to detect land cover change, a significant factor in anthropogenic emissions of CO2. We are part of the PalEON project, which is testing the way in which key land surface models represent carbon processes that play out on long time scales (such as change in plant species composition). With Forest Research we are working to understand the errors in observations of forest carbon balance, which is critical if we want to use these data to test models with. As part of the National Centre for Earth Observation we are working on using satellite observations of the land better to constrain predictions of the global carbon cycle. And last, but not least, we have several projects working on the development and testing of JULES, the land surface component of the Met Office Unified model – a key part of UK climate predictions that go into the IPCC reports.

The melting of Arctic sea ice and the future of trans-Arctic shipping
Posted on 21 December, 2015 by Stephen Burt
By Keith Haines
Most people will be familiar with news of the changing conditions in the Arctic where climate change seems to be at its fastest. The loss of sea ice each summer seems to show a rapidly declining trend, albeit with significant internannual variations. While the decline of summer sea ice in the Arctic may turn out disastrous for the current Arctic ecosystem, there could be positive effects for shipping as an ice-free arctic would provide much shorter trade routes between all north Atlantic ports and the Pacific ports in East Asia. But how can we assess the likely future scenarios for Arctic ice conditions?
Figure 1. The route of the Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) tanker Ob River through the Arctic in Nov 2012, and the ice distribution and concentration it met along the way, accompanied at this time by a Russian icebreaker.
After the September 2007 Arctic sea ice minimum it was quickly recognised that the current generation of climate models were under-representing Arctic variability. Sea ice modelling is now receiving more attention and models are improving, but this is a slow process. Can we use the most recent generation of climate models (IPCC CMIP5, Climate Model Intercomparison Project5) to say anything about the future of Arctic sea ice conditions?  One approach is to calibrate or “bias correct” the current models based on recent observations, and then project this correction forward to obtain future scenarios (Melia et al 2015). Nat Melia at Reading has calibrated both the mean sea ice conditions and the interannual variability by comparing climate model ensemble spread to the detrended interannual variations in the observational record. The relationship (Mean And VaRIance Correction, MAVRIC) is shown below, where the model mean ice distribution  is weighted differently to the interannual anomalies. The observed interannual variability should ensure that recent summer sea ice minima, e.g. 2007, 2011, are potentially represented in each model’s interannual variability:
This has allowed a set of calibrated CMIP5 climate models to predict the future mean (shown in Figure 2) and interannual variability of Arctic sea ice conditions.
Figure 2. The calibrated mean September CMIP5 sea ice thickness predictions, for each decade out to 2045. The current distribution on the left represents the 1979-2014 mean calibrated against the PIOMAS reanalysis record and therefore agrees well with current observations, followed by 2015-24, 2025-34, 2035-44 periods when the declining mean sea ice conditions can be seen. This does not represent what will actually be seen in any given year as there are plenty of interannual variations, which MAVRIC has also calibrated.
In this calibrated climate model framework the uncertainties in the predicted sea ice in any given year can be attributed to (1) interannual variability (orange in Figure 3), (2) variations between the climate models (blue), or (3) emission scenario uncertainty (green), following the approach of Hawkins and Sutton (2009).
Figure 3. The percentage uncertainty in predicted sea ice volume out to 100 years based on calibrated CMIP5 data. Initially all the uncertainty is due to interannual variability (orange), as it should be with climate models well calibrated for present conditions. The uncertainty between models (blue) then grows into the future and is dominant again between 30-70 years hence. Emission Scenario uncertainty (green) starts to matter after about 40 years and grows thereafter.
What does this new prediction mean for the future of Arctic shipping? Figure 4 shows the potential Arctic summer shipping routes between the north Atlantic and north Pacific. Almost all current traffic uses the northern sea route through Russian waters (light blue). However, the new ice predictions in Figures 2 and 3 suggest that the more direct route across the central Arctic (green) will likely become navigable by ~2045 while the North West Passage (red) will also be increasingly navigable and preferred for shipping from north American ports. New work is nearing completion analysing the probabilities of each of these sea routes being open to different categories of shipping into the future. The variability and range of possible routes can be displayed using the ensembles of calibrated CMIP products discussed above giving much more information about the risks and rewards of planning Arctic trade routes into the future. Further work will then follow to determine the likely potential to forecast summer ice conditions in a given year along these sea routes on a seasonal timescale (6 months in advance), to allow shipping decisions for the coming Arctic summer to be made more routinely.
Figure 4. Potential trans-Arctic summer shipping routes connecting the north Atlantic and north Pacific. Each route has a different probability of meeting sea ice of various thicknesses and this information is critical for planning of voyages that are likely to become much more routine in the coming decades.

Can the Web do more for science?
Posted on 14 December, 2015 by Stephen Burt
By Jon Blower
It goes without saying these days that we live in an immensely interconnected world. Scientists are nowadays typically continuously connected to the Web, accessing and publishing publications, educational material, opinions and, of course, data. But all this information is not, in fact, very well connected. It’s hard to find the exact data that were used in a study (particularly one that’s more than a couple of years old), or to find everything that is known about the strengths and limitations of a certain observing system. A lot of this information is out there somewhere, but it is published by lots of different organizations who don’t always know about each other, and so those vital links don’t get created.
To help scientists (and in fact all users of the Web), we need to impose a little more structure on all this information, and this is where the idea of “Linked Data” comes in. “Linked Data” encapsulates a set of principles that everyone can apply to make the content on the Web a bit less chaotic. The goal is to express information so precisely that even computers can understand it (at least to some degree), opening the door for more intelligent web sites, web browsers and search engines.
This blog isn’t the right place to go into technical details but, in essence, Linked Data means that we need to:
Create persistent, global and unique identifiers for the “things” that we care about in our community (such as researchers, Universities, projects, datasets, papers and even concepts) – see Figure 1 below.
Allow users to look up these identifiers on the Web to find out more about these things.
If a computer looks up an identifier, provide information in a machine-readable form: without going into details, the preferred format is RDF, which is a kind of “lingua franca” for data.
Embed links to other related things in this description using appropriate identifiers.
Include information on why things are linked. This is a key feature of the RDF format. So we can say that Paper A describes a dataset whereas Paper B uses it.
Figure 1. A (simplified) representation of some “things” that are important in the Earth Observation community, showing how they are linked.
Of course, there are many tough challenges to make this all work properly. It’s hard to get global agreements on identifiers and their definitions. Publishing Linked Data is not easy at the moment; but remember that 20 years ago, publishing basic web pages was also difficult for most non-specialists.
But this is a rapidly maturing area. Here at the Department of Meteorology we are involved in a number of projects to investigate how Linked Data can improve scientific research. These include:
CHARMe, in which we developed a Linked Data system to enable users to publish “commentary” about climate data – thereby sharing vital information about how data have been used in the community.
MELODIES, in which we are developing eight new applications of environmental Open Data, using Linked Data to join up diverse sources of data.
The Web is truly for everyone, and now it’s time to make it work better for science!

Projecting climate changes for the Earth System
Posted on 7 December, 2015 by Stephen Burt
By Robin Smith
With the COP21 UN climate change conference going on in Paris, questions about how the global environment will change in the coming decades and what impact that will have on the people and communities that live in them are once again at the top of the agenda. Much of this discussion is, of course, informed by the computer simulations of possible futures for the Earth’s climate system that are now routinely used to both understand how the system works and project the details of how it might change under specific conditions. Modelling groups around the world now take part in coordinated exercises – Model Intercomparison Projects (MIPs) – with simulations designed to help us better understand the implications of some of the uncertainties and gaps in our knowledge of the climate and to feed into further studies of how the changing climate will actually affect societies on the ground. MIPs have become major global projects in their own right – CMIP5, the largest such exercise yet that fed into the IPCCs recent fifth assessment report, ran from 2008 to 2015 and had barely finished before planning for CMIP6 started.
The number and complexity of climate modelling studies have largely followed the rise in available computing power since the end of the last century, going from niche exercises in aspects of atmospheric dynamics to models that attempt to cover every aspect of the Earth thought to be important for producing our climate. Today, most global climate models used for projections will not only include the physical aspects of the atmosphere and ocean, but also attempt interactively to model aspects of the Earth’s biogeochemical cycles that set the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. A relatively recent development over the last few years is the use of so-called Earth System Models (ESMs) for making future climate projections. ESMs represent another jump forward in the level of complexity that we attempt to model. Rather than being simply physical atmosphere and ocean models with selected parts of the carbon cycle put in as required to serve the physics, ESMs are more holistic, including more complete descriptions of (for example) atmospheric chemistry, methane-producing wetlands, plant biogeochemistry and the complex network of feedbacks that link these things to each other and to the more traditional atmospheric physics. Such models require teams of researchers from a wide range of Earth science backgrounds to work together to build them – and very significant computing resources to run them. The UK has thus setup a national project to build a next-generation ESM for our climate modelling community, with NERC and the MetOffice jointly funding the effort to produce the (not very imaginatively named!) UKESM, the first version of which will be released for use in late 2016 (Figure 1).
Figure 1. Schematic of the component models that will make up UKESM1 (see link for model details)
One of the major new pieces of modelling capability that will be built into UKESM will be the ability to model land-based ice. Terrestrial ice has some very strong feedbacks with the physical climate system – think of glacial cycles, with continental-scale icesheets covering large parts of the northern hemisphere – but ice has not been included in comprehensive climate models before now. There are both scientific and technical reasons for this. Land ice is generally thought of as interacting on much longer timescales than are considered for climate change projections, so is usually considered as a static boundary condition. There are also significant technical issues in coupling ice to global climate models. For example, it’s crucially important to use sub-kilometre spatial resolution in some regions to capture the essential ice dynamics, which is higher than can be used for most weather forecasting models, let alone climate models intended to run for many decades. The icesheet model that will be used in UKESM, BISICLES, deals with this problem by using an evolving, multi-resolution grid mesh that puts finer grid cells only in the regions where they’re required (Figure 2).  To communicate with the fine icesheet grid, however, we need further to adapt the atmosphere and ocean models with schemes that provide the ice with some sub-gridscale information from the rest of the climate.
Figure 2. The multiresolution BISICLES grid in a simulation of the iceshelf in Pine Island Bay, Antarctica (Cornford et al., 2013).
Land ice does not really exist as a static boundary condition, of course, even on climate projection timescales of centuries. Glaciers around the world are retreating and major Antarctic iceshelves are threatened with collapse. These changes don’t just affect the albedo of the Earth’s surface, but also the freshwater input to the ocean and the Southern Ocean deepwater formation that plays a key role in the global ocean circulation. There are major societal impacts associated with the changing ice as well, in terms of water availability to communities that rely on seasonal melt from glaciers and, of course, global sea level rise. Projections of sea level rise have until now been made by piecing together results from different types of studies done in different ways (Church et al. 2013). That is about to change, however, as a new international model intercomparison study, ISMIP6, will take the new generation of climate models, including those with interactive icesheets like UKESM, and use them to make fully consistent projections of sea level rise out to 2100 and beyond.
Integrating icesheets into climate models is pushing at the boundaries climate modelling, both in terms of our scientific understanding and our technical abilities. The sheer computational requirements of a modern global general circulation model means that UKESM will only be able to resolve the largest icesheets and iceshelves at first, so will not have individual glaciers as part of the interactive Earth system. And although having ESMs with such a complex network of feedbacks undoubtedly opens the door to exciting new areas of science, all this additional complexity does come with drawbacks. For one thing, the atmospheric chemistry model alone makes UKESM several times more expensive to run than the equivalent UK Met Office model without chemistry. Another issue around increasing model complexity is that we know there are fundamental aspects of the core atmosphere and ocean physical climate system that are still not being modelled sufficiently well. We cannot yet run our century-scale climate models with enough resolution to resolve fully convection in the atmosphere, or eddies in the ocean. Nor can we fully model how basic cloud microphysics really operates in the context of the large-scale climate response. The development of ESMs doesn’t mean that we think these issues aren’t important. It is simply that different science questions require different modelling tools, and the new capabilities of ESMs like UKESM provide powerful new tools that will help us understand how important aspects of the Earth system interact, and, importantly, how they may change in the future to form the environments we will be living in.

West Australian heatwaves and bush fires
Posted on 30 November, 2015 by Stephen Burt
By Mike Blackburn
As winter begins in Reading and snow already blankets the Alps, turn your thoughts for a moment to the southern hemisphere where extreme heat and bush fires are among the concerns of Australian forecasters at the beginning of summer.
Perth in the south-west of Western Australia (WA) has an enviable Mediterranean climate. The majority of its 770 mm annual precipitation falls in the winter half-year (May-October), when the region is most influenced by mid-latitude westerly winds and the storm-track over the Southern Ocean (Figure 1). In spring the subtropical high pressure moves south as low pressure develops over Northern Australia ahead of the summer monsoon, leading to easterly winds bringing dry continental air to the south-west throughout the warm season. High daytime temperatures are usually mitigated by the development of a south-westerly coastal sea breeze – known locally as the Fremantle Doctor – that propagates over the coastal plain to the hills of the Darling Range further inland.
Figure 1. Climatological mean sea level pressure for Winter (JJA, left) and Summer (DJF, right).
However the climatological averages mask large variability, particularly in daytime temperature. There are periods when the sea breeze is weak, arrives late and fails to penetrate far inland, leading to very high afternoon temperatures. While the November climatological average Tmax is 25.9 °C, the record Tmax is 40.8 °C and temperatures above 35 °C are not uncommon. This year the temperature reached 39.2 °C on 14 November, its highest in November since 2010: exhausting conditions for the Second Test between Australia and New Zealand at the WACA, Perth’s cricket ground, and an excuse for even the Royal visitors to head for the beach.
This variability of the sea breeze is intimately linked to the Australian west coast trough, evident in the summer MSL pressure climatology shown above. Idealised modelling studies by Kepert and Smith (1993) and Spengler, Reed and Smith (2005)  have shown that the trough is in essence a heat low in large-scale easterly flow, its position close to the west coast being determined by the surface heating contrast there.
Heatwaves are associated with intensification of the trough, when the easterly low-level wind turns north-easterly and brings hotter air from the tropical continental interior to the south-west. Westward movement of the trough off the coast also inhibits propagation of the south-west sea breeze in the north-easterly large-scale flow and by increasing surface pressure over land relative to the ocean. This was the situation during the heatwave in mid-November this year (Figure 2).
Figure 2. PMSL sequence for Nov 2015, 12-15 quartet showing High in Bight propagating east during the mid-November heatwave 2015: Courtesy of the Australian Bureau of Meteorology.
In the warm season, south-west Australia is still influenced by eastward propagating upper level troughs and surface pressure anomalies equatorward of mid-latitude storms in the Southern Ocean. As the charts above show, these can modulate low-level meridional flow over the continent, tending to intensify the west-coast trough following the passage of high pressure and ahead of trailing cold fronts.
Intensification of the West Australian trough reduces static stability and increases low level convergence and lifting, leading to increased risk of severe convection. In the otherwise tinder-dry environment lightning readily initiates bush fires, putting life and property at risk in settlements bordering the natural bush. Sadly the mid-November heatwave that broke with spectacular night-time thunderstorms over Perth on 14th also led to an extensive wildfire that lasted a week and killed four people in Esperance on the south coast. The ubiquitous nature of these phenomena over millennia is evident in the evolution of the WA natural flora, which accommodates and even takes advantage of fire. Many species protect their seeds in hard insulating nuts that only open after heating, releasing seed in the post-fire period. In a continent that extends from the tropics to mid-latitudes, Australian forecasters have many hazards on their agenda, but risk of extreme heat and fire will only increase as average temperatures continue to rise.
