The study found that the QS system triggered multilayered gene expression programs as a response to disinfectant exposure, including oxidative stress, ribosome synthesis, and nutrient absorption. The results suggest that QS plays a crucial role in protecting bacteria from disinfection by modulating their metabolic processes and physiological responses.
