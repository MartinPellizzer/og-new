Abstract. Urban Green Spaces (UGS) are widely advocated for mitigating urban atmospheric environment. However, this study reveals that it can exacerbate urban ozone (O3) levels under certain conditions, as demonstrated by a September 2017 study in Guangzhou, China. Utilizing the Weather Research and Forecasting Model with the Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature (WRF-MEGAN) and the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model with a high horizontal resolution (1 km), we assessed the impact of UGS-related biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) emissions on urban O3. Our findings indicate that UGS-BVOC emissions in Guangzhou amounted to 666.49 Gg, primarily from isoprene (ISOP) and terpenes (TERP). These emissions contribute ~30 % of urban ISOP concentrations and their incorporations to the model significantly reduce the underestimation against observations. The study shows improvements in simulation biases for NO2, from 7.01 µg/m3 to 6.03 µg/m3, and for O3, from 7.77 µg/m3 to -1.60 µg/m3. UGS-BVOC and UGS-LUCC (land use cover changes) integration in air quality models notably enhances surface monthly mean O3 predictions by 3.6–8.0 µg/m3 (+3.8–8.5 %) and contributes up to 18.7 µg/m3 (+10.0 %) to MDA8 O3 during O3 pollution episodes. Additionally, UGS-BVOC emissions alone increase the monthly mean O3 levels by 2.2–3.0 µg/m3 (+2.3–3.2 %) in urban areas and contribute up to 6.3 µg/m3 (+3.3 %) to MDA8 O3 levels during O3 pollution episodes. These impacts can extend to surrounding suburban and rural areas through regional transport, highlighting the need for selecting low-emission vegetation and refining vegetation classification in urban planning.
