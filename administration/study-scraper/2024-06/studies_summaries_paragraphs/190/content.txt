Here is a detailed summary of the study in one paragraph, focusing on the information and data related to ozone:

The degradation of UV328 by an ozone (O3) and peroxymonosulfate (PMS) system was investigated, showing that 97.0% of UV328 could be removed within 5 minutes at neutral pH with a concentration of 6.4 mg/min O3 and 2 mM PMS. The degradation rate was found to be positively correlated with the concentration of oxidants. Hydroxyl radical (•OH), sulfate radical (SO4•-), and singlet oxygen (1O2) were identified as participating in UV328 degradation, with 1O2 playing a key role. The study also proposed three degradation pathways: dehydrogenation, cycloaddition, and hydroxylation. Moreover, toxicity assessment revealed that O3/PMS treatment mitigated the ecological risks of UV328.
