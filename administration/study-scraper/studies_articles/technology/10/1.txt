The methods employed in this study involved four spectrometric techniques: ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm (UVA254), fluorescent excitation-emission matrix (EEM), synchronous fluorescence two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (SF-2DCOS), and EEM-parallel factor integrated 2DCOS (EEM-PARAFAC-2DCOS). The analysis focused on bovine serum albumin (BSA), humic acid sodium salt (HA), and actual EfOM samples from a wastewater treatment facility. The study aimed to investigate the changes in organic substances during chlorination and ozonation, as well as their structural modifications.
