Here are five detailed paragraphs based on the provided scientific study:

**Paragraph 1**
The study of carbon geo-sequestration applications has gained significant attention in recent years due to the pressing need to mitigate climate change. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a potent greenhouse gas that remains present in the atmosphere for extended periods, contributing to global warming. The development of practical models for computing CO2 solubility in brines with complex ions is crucial for successful carbon capture and sequestration. This study aims to develop a robust model that considers the effect of ionic strength, temperature, pressure, and salinity on CO2 solubility in deep saline aquifers.

**Paragraph 2**
The methods employed in this study involved developing a practical model using gradient boosting machines (GBMs) and comparing its performance with other machine learning algorithms. The dataset consisted of experimental data from various sources, which were used to train and validate the models. The developed model was tested against a wide range of conditions, including temperatures up to 723 K, pressures up to 200 MPa, and salinities up to 13 molarity.

**Paragraph 3**
The results showed that the developed model performed well in predicting CO2 solubility in brines with complex ions. The mean squared error was found to be 5 × 10−5, and the R-squared value was 0.96. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in capturing the complex interactions between CO2 and the various ions present in deep saline aquifers. Furthermore, the study found that the gradient boosting machine ranked as the most accurate algorithm among those tested.

**Paragraph 4**
The discussion highlights the importance of considering the complex ion composition of reservoir brines when predicting CO2 solubility. The developed model can be used to simulate various scenarios and optimize the conditions for effective carbon sequestration. The study also underscores the need for further research in this area, particularly in terms of experimental validation and incorporation of additional factors such as rock properties and fluid dynamics.

**Paragraph 5**
In conclusion, this study demonstrates the potential of machine learning algorithms in developing practical models for computing CO2 solubility in brines with complex ions. The developed model provides a valuable tool for carbon geo-sequestration applications and can be used to optimize the conditions for effective carbon capture and storage. Further research is needed to refine the model and incorporate additional factors, but this study represents an important step forward in addressing the pressing challenge of climate change.
