The research used a descriptive approach to analyze the spatial distribution of air pollutants in the western area of Tehran. Field observations and air quality monitoring data were collected from seven measurement stations, which were then analyzed using spatial statistics and interpolation techniques. Land use patterns were identified by creating buffers around each station with radii ranging from 500 to 2000 meters, and information was gathered on the main sources of pollution in each buffer.
