Non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) play a crucial role in atmospheric chemistry and have significant implications for ozone formation. Despite their importance, routine measurement of NMVOCs is limited in the UK and Europe, leading to a lack of understanding about their sources and sinks. This study aimed to investigate the non-methane volatile organic compound sources and sinks in England and Scotland, UK, using data from four monitoring sites: Marylebone, Eltham, Chilbolton, and Auchencorth.
