In conclusion, this study highlights the need for a new international agreement to address ozone depletion caused by emissions from orbital spacecraft. The findings suggest that existing agreements, such as the Outer Space Treaty and the Montreal Protocol, are insufficient in regulating these emissions. A comprehensive approach is necessary to ensure environmental protection while promoting sustainable space exploration and commercialization. Further research is recommended to develop a concrete framework for this new international agreement.
