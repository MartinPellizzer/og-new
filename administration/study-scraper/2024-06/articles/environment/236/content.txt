Here are the five paragraphs:

**Paragraph 1**

Introduction
The study examined whether neighborhood deprivation level is an effect measure modifier on the association between air pollution and birth outcomes in a North Carolina birth cohort. Air pollution has been linked to poor birth outcomes, but there is limited information on how environmental and social factors interact with one another to impact these outcomes. The study aimed to address this knowledge gap by analyzing data from all eligible births in North Carolina from 2011 to 2015.

**Paragraph 2**

Methods
The study population consisted of 566,799 live, singleton births with gestational ages between 20 and 44 weeks delivered from January 2011 to December 2015. The outcomes of interest were birth defects and preterm birth. Air pollution exposures were daily average fine particulate matter (PM2.5), daily 8-h maximum nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and daily 8-h maximum ozone (O3) concentrations. A neighborhood deprivation index (NDI) was created using principal component analysis on 2010 census variables, with three NDI levels: low, medium, or high deprivation.

**Paragraph 3**

Results
The study found that approximately 3.1% of the population had at least one birth defect and 8.18% were born preterm. For preterm birth, associations with PM2.5 and O3 did not follow a conclusive pattern, while NO2 exposure was generally negatively associated with preterm birth except for a positive association in high-NDI areas. There was no evidence of associations between pollutants examined and birth defects.

**Paragraph 4**

Discussion
The study's findings suggest that air pollution may have a greater impact on preterm birth in areas with higher levels of neighborhood deprivation, but further research is needed to confirm this finding. The inconsistent associations between air pollution and birth defects highlight the need for more robust evidence on the relationship between environmental pollutants and adverse birth outcomes.

**Paragraph 5**

Conclusion
In conclusion, while the study did not find conclusive evidence of modification by NDI in the association between air pollution and birth defects, it did suggest that neighborhood deprivation level may be an effect measure modifier on the association between NO2 exposure and preterm birth. The findings support the public health protection afforded by reductions in air pollution, even in areas with higher levels of neighborhood deprivation. Future research should investigate these associations further and explore the mechanisms by which environmental and social factors interact to impact birth outcomes.
