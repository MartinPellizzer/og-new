Abstract
A range of sleep disorders has the potential to adversely affect cognitive function. This study was undertaken with the objective of investigating the effects of ozone rectal insufflation (O3-RI) on cognitive dysfunction induced by chronic REM sleep deprivation, as well as elucidating possible underlying mechanisms. O3-RI ameliorated cognitive dysfunction in chronic REM sleep deprived mice, improved the neuronal damage in the hippocampus region and decreased neuronal loss. Administration of O3-RI may protect against chronic REM sleep deprivation induced cognitive dysfunction by reversing the abnormal expression of Occludin and leucine-rich repeat and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 inflammasome as well as interleukin-1β in the hippocampus and colon tissues. Moreover, the microbiota diversity and composition of sleep deprivation mice were significantly affected by O3-RI intervention, as evidenced by the reversal of the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes abundance ratio and the relative abundance of the Bacteroides genus. In particular, the relative abundance of the Bacteroides genus demonstrated a pronounced correlation with cognitive impairment and inflammation. Our findings suggested that O3-RI can improve cognitive dysfunction in sleep deprivation mice, and its mechanisms may be related to regulating gut microbiota and alleviating inflammation and damage in the hippocampus and colon.
INTRODUCTION
Sleep deprivation (SD) is a major contemporary public health problem characterized by partial or complete SD, leading to an inability to meet physiological sleep requirements. SD exerts detrimental effects on diverse physiological systems encompassing cardiovascular,[1] neurological,[2] immunological,[3] and endocrine.[4] At the same time, extensive research has consistently shown that SD, particularly rapid eye movement (REM) SD, also significantly impairs cognitive function.[5-8] Utilizing electroencephalography and electromyography, the sleep cycle in both humans and rodents is categorized into distinct phases, namely non-REM sleep and REM sleep. Given the profound association between REM sleep and crucial cognitive functions such as learning, memory, and emotional regulation in both humans and animals, REM SD has been extensively employed in animal experimentation and continues to be a prevalent methodology in contemporary research endeavors.
Numerous pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions, such as benzodiazepines, benzodiazepine-receptor agonists, and cognitive behavioral therapy have been proposed for SD treatments. However, these therapeutic options face limited acceptance due to notable side effects and limited therapeutic efficacy. Transcranial magnetic or electrical brain stimulation, as well as innovative approaches for delivering psychological interventions, are currently available but are in the research phase.[9] Hence, it is imperative to develop suitable therapy in this field. Ozone is a potent oxidant with potential therapeutic benefits for chronic diseases and is increasingly being studied for its beneficial effects in improving cognitive dysfunction.[10-13] Although these studies have elucidated some of the mechanisms underlying liquid ozone intraperitoneal injection in cognitive disorders, ozone rectal insufflation (O3-RI) is more prevalent in clinical practice which uses gaseous ozone injected into the rectum to heal and prevent disorders.[14] And in the clinical work of our team, O3-RI is a common method of Multimodal sleep treatment for insomnia.
The gut-brain axis encompasses a complex network involving various physiological systems, including the central nervous system, neuroendocrine system, neuroimmune system, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, autonomic nervous system comprising both the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches, the enteric nervous system, the vagus nerve, and the gut microbiota. Of particular significance is the pivotal role played by the gut microbiota in mediating communication between the gut and the brain, thereby giving rise to the concept of the microbiota-gut-brain axis. It is well-established that the microbiota-gut-brain axis plays a critical role in maintaining brain homeostasis and is implicated in various neurological and psychiatric disorders. These encompass a diverse spectrum of conditions, including but not limited to SD, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and major depressive disorder.[15-17] Specifically, alterations in gut microbiota composition can induce neurogenic and inflammatory responses within both the enteric and peripheral systems, thereby contributing to neuroinflammation.[18] Notably, the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain leucine-rich repeat and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome plays a crucial role in mediating immune and inflammatory reactions within both peripheral and central nervous system diseases.[19-22] In individuals afflicted with conditions such as SD, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and major depressive disorder, changes in gut microbiota can activate NLRP3, thereby initiating an inflammatory cascade that detrimentally affects the integrity of both the gut barrier and the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Consequently, these reactions contribute to central neuroinflammation and the progressive degeneration of neurological tissues.[23] This intricate web of interactions has been collectively described as the “microbiota-gut-NLRP3 inflammasome-brain axis”.[24]
The specific effects of O3-RI on cognitive impairment induced by chronic REM SD have yet to be explored. As a result, the aims of the research are as follows: (1) research into the effects of O3-RI treatment on the cognitive dysfunction of SD, and (2) to find out whether O3-RI can improve SD-induced cognitive function by inhibiting inflammation and regulating gut microbiota.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals and grouping
Laboratory procedures were meticulously conducted in strict adherence to the guidelines set forth by the National Institutes of Health for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. We procured specific-pathogen-free male ICR mice aged 7 weeks with a weight range of 32–34 g from Jinan Pengyue Laboratory Animal Breeding Co., Ltd. (Jinan, Shandong, China; animal license No. SCXK (Lu) 2019-0003). These mice were subsequently housed within the facilities of the Experimental Animal Center at the Shandong Second Medical University. Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the Animal Experiment Committee of Shandong Second Medical University (approval date: June 15, 2023, No. 2023SDL259). A total of five mice were accommodated per plastic cage within a room maintained at a temperature of 25°C, and the light intensity of the room was 15–20 lx. The alternation of light and dark was 12/12-hour. The mice were provided with unrestricted food and water. A 1-week acclimatization period was provided before the commencement of the experiment.
Male ICR mice were randomly assigned: control group (Ctrl group, n = 12), SD group (n = 12), low-concentration O3-RI group (O3-RI-L group, n = 12), and high-concentration O3-RI group (O3-RI-H group, n = 12).
REM SD
This research used the modified multiple platforms method to establish models. This method led to a nearly 95% reduction in REM sleep.[25,26] Mice were kept in a plastic tank (40 cm × 25 cm × 15 cm) filled with water maintained at a temperature of 25°C. The tank was equipped with 15 small platforms, arranged in three rows to allow mice to freely move between platforms. The water level cannot be as high as the surface of the platform. Following a 1-week adaptation period, mice underwent 20 hours of SD per day for three consecutive weeks (Figure 1). SD was administered from 12:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m. of the following day.[27]

O3-RI treatment
The gaseous ozone in this study was created by an ozone generator (OZOMED Basic; Kastner-Praxisbedarf-GmbH, Rastatt, Germany), and the applied dose was 1.1 mg/kg. Considering the toxicity associated with high concentrations of ozone and the intestinal tolerance of mice, we used safe and appropriate gaseous ozone concentrations (10 or 20 μg/mL) previously reported in the literature for this experimental study.[28] On day 15, mice were immobilized, and an antioxidant cannula (0.1 mm × 5 cm) was carefully inserted into the colorectum of each mouse to a depth of 2–3 cm. To prevent gas leakage, the anus of the mice was gently manually sealed for a period of 3 to 5 minutes following treatment. The O3-RI treatment was performed for 5 minutes each time and once a day for 7 consecutive days. The Ctrl and SD groups underwent immobilization but did not receive O3-RI treatment.
Y-maze test
Measurement of spontaneous alternation
This test was utilized to evaluate short-term working memory. The device (Shanghai Xinsoft Information Technology Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) comprised three arms (30 cm × 5 cm × 15 cm), with an angle of 120° between them. The central region of the maze formed a triangular shape. Each mouse was placed from the same arm, the starting arm, and alternated autonomously for 5 minutes continuously. During this period, the number of arm entries and the order of arm exploration were meticulously recorded. The initial two arm entries were excluded from the analysis. Starting from the third arm entry, any subsequent entry into an arm distinct from the previous two was considered a correct arm entry.[29]
Measurement of spatial memory
The experimental procedure encompassed two distinct phases: training and testing. During the training phase, mice were only given a 5-minute opportunity to explore two of the arms. Before testing, the mice were placed in their holding cages for 1 hour. In the testing phase, the mice were positioned in the same arm and subsequently granted to explore all three arms for a 5-minute exploration period. And the duration of time spent in the novel arm and the number of entries made into the novel arm were meticulously recorded. The mice exhibiting proficient spatial memory would exhibit a higher frequency of entries into the previously unexplored (novel) arm. Conversely, the mice with impaired spatial memory would display no specific tendency.[30]
Novel object recognition test
First day, each mouse was acclimatized in the test apparatus (Shanghai Xinsoft Information Technology Co., Ltd.) for 5 minutes. On the second day, the mice were kept in the apparatus with their backs facing the two identical objects and then granted the freedom to explore the area for a period of 5 minutes. One hour later, the mice were placed in the test apparatus in the same way, wherein one object remained familiar, while the other was replaced by a novel object. The mice were also afforded 5 minutes of exploration time to investigate both objects. The time spent exploring the familiar object (TF) and the time spent exploring the novel object (TN) were recorded and subsequently analyzed. The recognition index (RI, %) = [TN / (TN + TF)] × 100.[31]
Open field test
The open field test was employed to assess the anxiety levels of the mice. The test took place within an open field apparatus constructed from black frosted acrylic plates (dimensions: 50 cm × 50 cm × 30 cm). A period of 5 minutes was allocated for the assessment of mouse behavior, during which their activities were recorded using an overhead video camera. Upon completion of each trial, the apparatus was thoroughly cleaned to remove any feces or urine, disinfected with a 75% ethanol solution, and dried using gauze. Subsequent data analysis was conducted using the SuperMaze software (Xinruan Information Technology Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China), allowing for the evaluation of parameters such as traveling distance, traveling speed, and the time spent in the open field.[32]
Tissue and fecal sample collection
After behavioral tests, and before sacrifice, the mice were transferred into empty cages and waited for natural defecation. During defecation, the feces were collected in time to avoid contamination of the feces by the mice. The samples were placed into an individual 1.5 mL aseptic centrifuge tube. Subsequently, the collected fecal samples were promptly stored at a temperature of −80°C to ensure their preservation for subsequent microbiome analysis. Notably, all feces were collected during the same time period to maintain consistency. Following the fecal sample collection, the mice were sacrificed while they were deeply anesthetized, and deep anesthesia was induced in the mice using sodium pentobarbital (150 mg/kg, intraperitoneal, Shanghai New Asia Pharmaceutical Co., Shanghai, China). Tissues from the hippocampus and colon were swiftly excised and immediately stored at a temperature of −80°C for future utilization in western blotting experiments. Simultaneously, tissues from the brain and colon were harvested and subjected to fixation, embedding, and sectioning procedures for histopathological and immunofluorescence staining analyses.
Hematoxylin-eosin staining
The procedure involved staining the hippocampus sections with hematoxylin (Solarbio, Beijing, China) and then rinsing the sections quickly in distilled water. Then the
