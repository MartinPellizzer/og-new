Abstract
The environmental impacts of buildings have become a major challenger during the recent years, as they produce 30% of the world’s landfill waste, utilize more than 40% of the energy produced worldwide, and emit one third of all greenhouse gas emissions. This study uses systematic literature review based on the Social Science Citation Index databases to identify the publication of the building life cycle assessment (LCA) literature produced between 2000 and 2021. The significant rise in the number of global research, the United States is in the lead. When it comes to building life cycle assessments, the Norwegian University of Science and Technology is regarded as the pioneer in the field of research. In addition, the United Kingdom has contributed over 161 publications and Switzerland has contributed 84 studies. However, over the last 20 years, the United States has contributed 449 valuable papers on the LCA of buildings. The review of 53 articles reveals that the CML2002 and eco indicator 99 methods are frequently used, along with the four indicators global warming potential, photochemical ozone creation potential, and acidification potential. However, the number of LCA studies conducted in Africa is limited. Suggestions for future research are proposed to address these gaps and expand the scope of green building research in Morocco.
