In conclusion, this study presents a novel mechanistic model for ozone decomposition processes in secondary wastewater effluent with initial ozone demand. The proposed model balances accuracy and complexity, providing a simplified framework for understanding the main phases of ozone decomposition. The results demonstrate the potential of this approach to improve process control and optimization, ultimately enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of ozone-based wastewater treatment systems.
