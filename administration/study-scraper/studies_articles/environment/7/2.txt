The results showed that concentrations of PM10 and PM2.5 exceeded both national and global guidelines across all sites throughout the study period. Industrial sites were classified as severe category according to the National Air Quality Index. The ozone formation potential (OFP) of benzene and toluene was observed to be higher in industrial sites compared to commercial sites. The health risk assessment using the AirQ+ model indicated a strong association between PM10 exposure and mortality from respiratory and chronic bronchitis diseases.
