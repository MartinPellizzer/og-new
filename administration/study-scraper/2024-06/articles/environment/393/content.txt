Here are five detailed paragraphs based on the scientific study:

**Paragraph 1**
Ground-level ozone (O3) is a major air pollutant that poses significant health risks. Exposure to O3 has been linked to premature mortality from respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. In Europe, O3 pollution remains a major public health concern, with over 95% of the population exposed to levels exceeding World Health Organization guidelines. Despite this, mitigation efforts have primarily focused on national and regional scales, lacking a comprehensive assessment of the geographic sources of O3 pollution and its associated mortality burden.

**Paragraph 2**
This study aimed to quantify the contribution of national and imported O3 to mortality across Europe. We used air-quality modeling as a source-apportionment method and exposure-response associations characterizing the effects of O3 on human mortality. Our analysis integrated data from 35 European countries and 813 contiguous regions, representing approximately 530 million people.

**Paragraph 3**
The results show that imported O3 contributed to 88.3% of all O3-attributable deaths, with the greatest share originating outside the study domain (56.7%). The contribution of other European countries was also substantial, accounting for 20.9% of total attributable mortality. The estimated number of deaths attributable to O3 over the entire European domain during the warm seasons of 2015-2017 was 114,447, resulting in an attributable mortality rate of 72.0 annual deaths per 1 million inhabitants.

**Paragraph 4**
The study highlights the need for coordinated actions among countries to reduce O3 concentrations and health impacts. The results demonstrate that a small fraction of O3-attributable deaths was due to national sources (11.7%), while the largest mortality burden was associated with hemispheric O3 transported from outside the European domain (56.7%). Moreover, the contribution of other European countries had a substantial impact on mortality in many regions.

**Paragraph 5**
In conclusion, this study provides a comprehensive assessment of the geographic sources of O3 pollution and its associated mortality burden across Europe. The results emphasize the importance of transboundary air pollution and highlight the need for coordinated efforts to reduce O3 concentrations and health impacts. Future research should refine the present study by analyzing the contribution of different economic sectors or activities to transported transboundary O3, shedding additional light on interventions required in key strategic economic sectors.
