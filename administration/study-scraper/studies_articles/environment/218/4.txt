In conclusion, this study provides new insights into the complex interplay between the QBO and stratospheric ozone. The results highlight the need for improved models that can capture both temperature-driven changes and circulation-driven changes in ozone concentrations. Further research is needed to fully understand the impacts of climate change on stratospheric ozone and to improve climate projections.
