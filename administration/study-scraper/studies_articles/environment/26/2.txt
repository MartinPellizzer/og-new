Our results show that surface O3 concentrations have increased significantly across most regions in China during the past two decades. We found a pronounced increase in O3 levels during the summer months, with peak values exceeding 100 ppb in some areas. The eastern regions of China, particularly the Yangtze River Delta and the Pearl River Delta, showed higher O3 concentrations than other regions. Our analysis also revealed that O3 pollution is closely linked to meteorological variables such as temperature and humidity.
