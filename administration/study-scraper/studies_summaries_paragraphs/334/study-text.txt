Here is a detailed summary of the study in one paragraph:

Nitrous oxide (N2O), an ozone-depleting greenhouse gas, emissions are increasing due to agricultural practices. The denitrification pathway, which reduces nitrate to nitrogen under anaerobic conditions, is regulated by FNR transcriptional regulators. This study investigated small RNAs (sRNAs) controlled by FNR regulators in Paracoccus denitrificans and identified 7 sRNAs with a putative FNR binding motif upstream of their promoter region. Three candidate sRNAs, sRNA18, sRNA36, and sRNA79, showed characteristics indicative of involvement in denitrification. Overexpression of sRNA36 impacted N2O reduction rates, and FNR regulation was experimentally confirmed, suggesting that sRNAs under FNR control play a key role in regulating denitrification and potentially influencing ozone levels.
