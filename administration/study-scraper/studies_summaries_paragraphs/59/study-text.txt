Here is a summary of the study in 1 detailed paragraph, focusing on the information and data related to ozone:

A record high March 2024 Arctic total column ozone was observed at 478 Dobson Units (DU), surpassing the previous record by 60 DU and 6 DU higher than the average. The daily Arctic ozone values were above average for every day in March 2024, with a concentration of record highs from 11 to 26 March. Microwave Limb Sounder data revealed that this anomaly was confined to the lower stratosphere (10-30 km). This phenomenon developed over the 2023-2024 winter and is linked to planetary-scale wave events causing significant stratospheric warmings, which led to record column ozone levels through poleward and downward advection.
