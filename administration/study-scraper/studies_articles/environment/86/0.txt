Air pollution is a significant environmental health issue affecting urban populations and surrounding ecosystems. The United States has several metropolitan regions with varying concentrations of air pollutants, which can impact public health and ecosystem services. Understanding the factors contributing to these differences is crucial for addressing health issues as the human population continues to increase and communities across the globe adapt to these trends. This study aims to investigate the impact of natural processes and anthropogenic sources on pollutant concentrations in seven metropolitan regions across the US.
