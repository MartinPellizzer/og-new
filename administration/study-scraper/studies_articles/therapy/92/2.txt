The results showed that of the 523 patients, 12 experienced major skin complications like infection and necrosis, while 511 had no or minor issues such as discoloration. Of the patients without major complications, 299 (58.3%) received ozone therapy, while 212 (41.7%) did not. In contrast, among the 12 patients with major complications, two (16.7%) received ozone therapy, and the remaining 10 (83.3%) did not. The results indicated that ozone therapy recipients had statistically fewer skin problems (p<0.05).
