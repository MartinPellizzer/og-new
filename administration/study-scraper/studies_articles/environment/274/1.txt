To investigate the omics responses of plants to air pollution, researchers used a combination of laboratory and field studies. They analyzed the gene expression profiles of plants exposed to different concentrations of O3, NOX, and PM, as well as their antioxidant enzyme activities and hormone signaling pathways. The study employed various omics technologies, including transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, to comprehensively characterize the molecular responses of plants to air pollution.
