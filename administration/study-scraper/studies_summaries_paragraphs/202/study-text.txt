Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the study's findings related to ozone:

The study investigated the efficient degradation of p-nitrophenol (PNP) from water using dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma with ozone circulation. The results showed that circulating ozone in the DBD reactor significantly improved PNP degradation efficiency, increasing it from 57.4% to 94.4%. Additionally, energy yield improved by 130%, attributed to the release of more long-lived and short-lived reactive species (RONS) in the DBD-O3 system compared to the conventional DBD system. The study also demonstrated that ozone circulation did not significantly affect pH, initial concentration, or co-existing substances in the water matrix, suggesting minimal impact on the degradation process. Overall, the findings propose a promising strategy to improve the utilization of DBD for PNP degradation by enhancing dielectric barrier discharge plasma through ozone circulation.
