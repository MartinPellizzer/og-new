Here is a summary of the study in 1 detailed paragraph focusing on ozone:

The study examined the effect of ozone exposure on the growth of Eurotium amstelodami IS-SAB-01, an xerophilic fungus isolated from naan bread. Two levels of ozone treatment were used: low-level long-term exposure (0.4 μmol/mol for 21 days) and high-level short-term exposure (300 μmol/mol for 5 to 120 minutes). The results showed that the growth of the isolate was sensitive to low-level ozone fumigation, with significant reduction in asexual spore formation in media with no added sucrose, but not in media with higher sucrose levels. Additionally, high-level ozone exposure reduced spore viability, with 100% reduction achieved after 120 minutes. The study also observed that ozone induced oxidative stress, which appeared to reduce the formation of cleistothecia. Overall, the findings suggest that ozone may be effective in reducing spoilage by Eurotium amstelodami IS-SAB-01 in low moisture foods, but the effects depend on the concentration and duration of ozone exposure, as well as the presence or absence of sucrose in the growth medium.
