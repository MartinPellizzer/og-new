Here is a summary of the study in 1 detailed paragraph, focusing on information and data related to ozone:

The study investigates the use of palladium-modified Bi₂WO₆/BiOCl composites for enhanced water decontamination through photocatalysis. The results show that the addition of palladium improves Rhodamine B (RhB) photodegradation by approximately 25% compared to the unmodified composite, with the optimal amount being 0.5 wt%. The improved activity is attributed to the formation of a Schottky junction and surface plasmon resonance, which enhances visible light responsiveness and suppresses electron-hole recombination. Notably, the study does not involve ozone disinfection, but rather focuses on advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) such as photocatalysis using semiconductor materials like Bi₂WO₆/BiOCl.
