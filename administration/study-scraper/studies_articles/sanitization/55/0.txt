The destruction of ozone is a crucial environmental issue due to its impact on stratospheric chemistry and global climate. Understanding the reaction mechanisms involved in ozone destruction is essential for developing effective strategies to mitigate this problem. This study focuses on the surface reaction between ozone and oxygen atoms, which plays a significant role in ozone destruction. The researchers employed absorption spectroscopy to measure the time dependence of ozone concentration and derived the pseudo first-order rate constant from this data.
