---------------------------------------------------

problem:
	Ozone VS germination ability, germination under salt stress, seedling growth, seedling root length,
	conductivity and inactivation of endogenous microflora

experiment:
	corn seeds immersed in ozone water
	12.5 g/m3 of ozone
	1, 3, and 5 min
	at room temperature

result:
	ozone: 100% germination on day 2
	control: 66.6% germination on day 8
	taller and stronger seedling (longer roots)
	germination under 100mM salt stress was higher
	electrical conductivity affected by measurement time more than ozone
	5.31 log inactivation of aerobic mosophilic bacteria
	6.15 log inactivation of mold and yeast of endogenous bacteria
	best results: 12.5 g/m3, 5 min
		
objective:
	ozone can inactivate endogenous microflora and improve seedling vigor
