In conclusion, this study demonstrated the importance of meteorological factors in determining surface ozone pollution characteristics in Xiangtan. The findings highlight the need for more accurate and timely forecasting of these factors to mitigate O3 pollution. Moreover, the study suggests that local emissions have limited effects on O3 generation in the region. Further research is necessary to investigate the role of anthropogenic activities and natural processes in shaping surface ozone concentrations in Xiangtan and other regions with similar characteristics.
