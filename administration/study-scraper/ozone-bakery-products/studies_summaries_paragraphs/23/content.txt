Here is a summarized paragraph focusing on the information and data related to ozone:

Ozone (O3) has been recognized as an effective fumigant for killing insects, destroying mycotoxins, and inactivating microorganisms in food grains. Studies have shown that ozone can achieve up to 3 log reductions of microorganisms in cereal grains, peas, and beans depending on concentration, temperature, and exposure time. Ozone is also effective in degrading commonly occurring mycotoxins such as aflatoxin, patulin, and ochratoxin A. However, excessive use of ozone can promote oxidation degradation of chemical constituents present in the grains, leading to surface oxidation, discoloration, or development of undesirable odors. Despite these potential drawbacks, ozone is considered a viable alternative to traditional fumigants for grain storage due to its minimal effect on grain quality and its ability to auto-decompose rapidly, leaving no residues behind.
