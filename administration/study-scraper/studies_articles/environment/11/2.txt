The results demonstrate that Pandora data flagged as medium or low quality can be scientifically useful when filtered by independent uncertainty. In fact, applying this filter increased the availability of scientifically useful data by up to 90% above that tagged as high quality. Moreover, combining direct-sun and sky-scan observations into a single dataset revealed strong relationships between Pandora HCHO columns and surface ozone measurements.
