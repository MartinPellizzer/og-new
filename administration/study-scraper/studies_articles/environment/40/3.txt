The findings highlight the importance of joint prevention and control of O3 pollution in Siping, as well as optimization of biogenic landscape ecology and control of VOCs and NOx emissions in both industrial and transport sectors. The results also suggest that wind direction from the southwest plays a crucial role in transporting high-O3 air masses to Siping. Furthermore, the study underscores the need for more detailed research on the sources and sinks of O3 precursors.
