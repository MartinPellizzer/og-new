Here is a summarized paragraph focusing on the information and data related to ozone:

The study highlights the significance of CO2 solubility in brines with complex ions for carbon geo-sequestration applications. It develops a practical model considering ionic strength, temperature, pressure, and salinity up to 723 K, 200 MPa, and 13 molarity. The model's validation against experimental data shows a mean squared error of 5 × 10−5 and an R-squared value of 0.96. Notably, the study does not discuss ozone (O3) or its contribution to climate change, unlike reactive gases like nitrous substances, which are mentioned as short-lived contributors. The focus is solely on CO2 solubility for carbon geo-sequestration applications.
