Extreme bushfire events have devastating impacts on climate change, causing widespread destruction and economic damage. The 2019/2020 Australian bushfires were particularly catastrophic, injecting large amounts of aerosols and gases into the stratosphere and depleting the ozone layer. While previous studies have focused on the drivers behind ozone depletion, the effects of bushfire aerosols on polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) remain poorly understood. This study aims to investigate the impact of Australian bushfires on PSC dynamics and chemistry.
