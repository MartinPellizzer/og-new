In conclusion, this systematic review and meta-analysis provide evidence that ozone therapy may have additional benefits in treating DFUs. While the results are promising, future studies should aim to improve study design, reduce heterogeneity, and investigate the optimal use of ozone therapy in DFU management. Further research is necessary to fully understand the potential benefits of ozone therapy for patients with DFUs and to inform clinical practice guidelines.
