The discussion highlights the importance of ongoing refinements for reliable air quality predictions from the UFS-AQM model. The updated model does not improve model performance for PM2.5 in the vicinity of fire emission sources, indicating a focal point of model uncertainty and needed improvement. The study also underscores the significance of addressing these challenges to ensure accurate air quality forecasts.
