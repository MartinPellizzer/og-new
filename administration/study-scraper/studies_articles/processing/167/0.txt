In this study, researchers aimed to develop an efficient process for degrading Tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) in semiconductor wastewater. TMAH is a toxic and recalcitrant pollutant that poses significant environmental concerns. The ozone-activated peroxymonosulfate (O3/PMS) process has been gaining attention as a potential treatment method for removing organic pollutants. This study explored the application of O3/PMS to degrade TMAH in artificial semiconductor wastewater.
