Abstract
Recently, nitrate (NO3–) levels in winter pollution in eastern China have been increasing yearly and have become the main component of PM2.5. The factors contributing to this rise in surface NO3– concentrations remain unclear, complicating the development of targeted pollution control measures. This study utilizes observational data from Shanghai during the winter 2019, alongside box model simulations, to recreate the NO3− pollution event and identify the key factors in the growth process. The analysis demonstrated that a rise in winter ozone levels significantly promotes NO3– production by facilitating NOx conversion via gas-phase and heterogeneous reactions. These findings could explain the correlation between the synchronous increase of surface ozone and NO3− in recent years. Furthermore, simulation of control strategies for NOx and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) identified an approach centered on ozone reduction as notably effective in mitigating winter NO3– pollution in the Yangtze River Delta.

Introduction
The Chinese government has implemented stringent air pollution control policies since 2013. However, the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) is characterized by severe air pollution1,2, evident from the frequent exceedance of the Chinese air quality second-level standard for 24-h average PM2.5 concentration, which is ≤75 μg m−3. During these high pollution episodes, PM2.5 concentrations are often compounded by increased levels of water-soluble inorganic salts, including sulfate (SO42−) and nitrate (NO3−)3. While the reduction in sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions has successfully decreased SO42− concentrations4,5, a similar reduction strategy for nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions has not effectively reduced NO3− levels6,7. Instead, there has been a significant increase in the nitrogen-to-sulfur ratio in PM2.5, highlighting a growing proportion of NO3− in PM2.5 during the winter season8,9. Consequently, NO3− pollution has emerged as a primary target for air quality management in the YRD3,10.
Nitrate formation involves complex multiphase chemical reactions. During the daytime, NO2 reacts with the hydroxyl radical (OH) to produce gaseous nitric acid (HNO3). Subsequently, under ammonia-rich conditions, this reaction can proceed quickly and produce high concentrations of ammonium nitrate11,12. At nighttime, NO3− mainly originates from the heterogeneous hydrolysis of N2O5 on wet particles, contributing to 56–97% of nocturnal nitrate formation13,14. While numerous studies have explored these formation mechanisms concerning local NO3− and PM2.5 pollution, the correlation between nitrate and O3 pollution has not been adequately addressed, particularly in China15. Nitrate formation is influenced by the concentration of NOx precursors and the levels of O3 produced through NOx and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) interaction16. Elevated O3 levels during the daytime promote HNO3 formation (reactions 1-2)17, while nighttime nitrate production predominantly occurs through N2O5 hydrolysis (reaction 3) initiated by NO3 (reaction 4), which itself is produced from O3 reacting with NO2 (reaction 5). This suggests that nighttime O3 concentration has a significant effect on nitrate production18. The relationship between NO3− and NOx emissions is nonlinear, with variations depending on O3 sensitivity, highlighting the complex interaction between nitrate and O3 levels19,20. Understanding this relationship is crucial for devising strategies that simultaneously address O3 and PM2.5 pollution21.

In this study, we focus on elucidating the critical processes and variables influencing winter nitrate enhancement in the YRD, emphasizing the role of O3 as a photochemical oxidant. Unlike prior studies by Zhou et al.7 and Zang et al.22, which respectively addressed N2O5 hydrolysis and atmospheric oxidation capacity, our work conducts a thorough analysis of the impact of O3 on nitrate pollution through direct measurements and the observation-based model (OBM) simulations. Advancing the discussion initiated by Fu et al.17 regarding photochemical oxidants, our research offers a detailed examination of the factors driving nitrate formation and suggests potential for coordinated O3 and PM2.5 mitigation strategies. The observation data provide a regional picture of winter nitrate pollution in the YRD and a specific dataset to evaluate the model capacity for simulating the nitrate pollution. Our results indicate surface O3 levels have a crucial role in shaping and regulating nitrate pollution in the YRD region during winter.
Results and discussion
Enhanced winter nitrate pollution amid increasing ozone levels
Since the implementation of stringent air quality measures in 2013, the YRD region has seen notable improvements in air quality, as evidenced by the decline in PM2.5 and NO2 levels, especially in densely populated areas like Shanghai and its surroundings (Fig. 1A, B and Supplementary Fig. 1). However, O3 pollution has shown a contrary trend, increasing over time, which is depicted in Fig. 1C. The average MDA8 O3 level in winter 2020 exceeded that of 2014 across most of the YRD, partly due to the uncoordinated NOx and VOC reductions that favorable for O3 photochemical production23.

Our prior research21, leveraging COVID-19 lockdown data and chemical modeling, confirmed that the increase in surface O3 in YRD is primarily due to human activities rather than meteorological conditions. During the lockdown, emission reductions led to an increase in the maximum rate of O3 production in the YRD by 0.73 ppb h−1 (Fig. 1D). Specifically, a 60% reduction in NOx emissions resulted in a 4 ppb h−1 increase in the maximum O3 production rate, a 22% reduction in VOCs emissions led to a 3.3 ppb h−1 decrease in this rate. Thus, the significant rise in surface O3 (89%) is largely due to the increased O3 production caused by NOx abatement exceeding the decrease in O3 production triggered by VOCs abatement. Meanwhile, the nitrate levels in the YRD have also increased, indicating a complex challenge in managing air quality24.
Figure 1E presents an analysis of the variations in winter concentrations of NO3− and SO42− in the YRD from 2013 to 202017,25,26,27,28,29. In winter 2020, SO42− concentration significantly fell from 13.0 μg/m3 to 5.7 μg/m3, reducing its contribution to PM2.5 from 20% to 15%. This decline is mainly due to a substantial decrease in SO2 emission in the YRD30. In contrast, the NO3− concentration saw a slight increase from 13.2 μg/m3 to 15.5 μg/m3 during the same period, raising its contribution to PM2.5 from 20% to 33%. This marks NO3− as an increasingly predominant pollutant in PM2.5, likely due to a rise in N2O5 hydrolysis, encouraged by higher surface O3 levels18. Other studies have also indicated that surface O3 has been steadily increasing21. It is crucial to explore the relationship between O3 growth and NO3− pollution to fully understand and mitigate the PM2.5 and O3 combined pollution problem in the YRD.
Figure 2A–E shows a series of data on temperature (TEMP), relative humidity (RH), and air pollutants, including NO3−, in Shanghai from January 1 to February 29, 2019. To effectively investigate the characteristics of NO3− pollution, we classified days with average NO3− levels of 20 μg/m3 or higher as NO3− pollution (NP) days, and those below this threshold as non-NO3− pollution (NNP) days. Five NP events were recorded during this period, totaling 12 days, all featuring pronounced increases in NO3−, NOx, and VOCs levels (Fig. 2B). Notably, NO3− concentrations were 270% higher during NP days (32 μg m−3) compared to NNP days (8.4 μg m−3), with a similar upward trend observed for HNO3, which increased by 177% (Fig. 2F). The rapid growth of TNO3 ( = NO3− + HNO3) during NP days may have been a consequence of an increase in its precursors, namely HONO, NOx, and VOCs, which were increased by 110%, 106%, and 87%, respectively. Temperature also played a role, enhancing the chemical reactions that form TNO3. Our analysis indicates a strong correlation between NO3–, HNO3, and their precursors, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.4 to 0.55 (Supplementary Fig. 2). This pattern is consistent with findings from Nanjing18, where high NO2 and VOCs levels accelerated nocturnal NO3 formation. Additionally, we found HNO3 is inversely related to RH, with high humidity slowing photochemical reactions and reducing HNO3 formation31. The contribution of NO3− to PM2.5 also increased from 24% during NNP days to 34% during NP days, highlighting that secondary oxidation processes in the YRD region are more severe25,32.

In this study, a comprehensive source and sink of NO3− were added to the OBM model (Fig. 3A and Methods), and this model was often used to simulate NO3− pollution events (Fig. 3B)18,22,33,34,35,36,37. To minimize model uncertainty, we conducted simulations in three distinct parts: the first simulation covered January 3 to January 16, addressing the first two NO3− pollution events; the second simulation spanned from January 8 to January 27, capturing the third and fourth events; and the third simulation ran from February 13 to February 27, 2020, encompassing the fifth event. The results, depicted in Fig. 3C–E, indicated that the improved OBM model effectively simulated the NO3− concentration during the pollution events (R2 = 0.71–0.85). Previous studies have shown that this model can also reproduce O3 photochemical production and atmospheric free radical chemistry38. Consequently, the OBM model serves as a valuable tool for dissecting the causes of NO3− pollution in the YRD during winter, particularly in relation to ozone and free radical chemistry.
