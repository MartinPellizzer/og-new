The results of this study show that a total of 65825 ro-vibrational transitions were analyzed, out of which 65585 were validated. This resulted in the determination of 16717 MARVEL energy levels of $^{16}$O$_{3}$, including 69 vibrational levels with the maximum value of J (rotational angular momentum quantum number) reaching J=77. The MARVEL energies extend up to 8277.30 cm$^{-1}$. A comparison with effective Hamiltonian (EH) energy levels showed a mean energy difference ($\Delta E_{mean}$) equal to -1.54 × 10$^{-4}$ cm$^{-1}$ and standard deviation 4.58 × 10$^{-3}$ cm$^{-1}$ for 14835 energy levels matched between them.
