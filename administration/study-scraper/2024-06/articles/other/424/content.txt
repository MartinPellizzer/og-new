Here are five detailed paragraphs based on the scientific study:

**Paragraph 1**
The relationship between plant-based diet indices (PDIs) and ovarian cancer (OC) survival remains unclear. Ambient air pollution has been suggested as a potential prognostic factor for OC survival, but its interaction with PDIs is not well understood. A prospective cohort study was conducted to investigate the associations of comprehensive air pollution and PDIs with OC survival and explore the effects of air pollution-diet interactions.

**Paragraph 2**
The present study included 658 patients diagnosed with OC. The overall plant-based diet index (PDI), healthful PDI, and unhealthful PDI (uPDI) were evaluated using a self-reported validated food frequency questionnaire. An air pollution score (APS) was formulated by summing the concentrations of particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 microns or less, ozone, and nitrogen dioxide. Cox proportional hazard models were applied to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of overall survival (OS).

**Paragraph 3**
Throughout a median follow-up of 37.60 months, 123 deaths were confirmed. Higher uPDI was associated with lower OS of OC (HR=2.06, 95%CI=1.30, 3.28; P-trend<0.01), whereas no significant association was found between overall PDI and hPDI and OC survival. Higher APS was significantly associated with worse OC survival (HR for per interquartile range=1.27, 95%CI=1.01, 1.60). The associations could be exacerbated by adhering to uPDI.

**Paragraph 4**
The findings suggest that joint exposure to various ambient air pollutants is significantly associated with lower survival among patients with OC, particularly for those who predominantly consume unhealthy plant-based foods. Adherence to overall PDI aggravated the associations of air pollution with OC survival. The results also indicate an additive interaction between combined air pollution and uPDI.

**Paragraph 5**
In conclusion, this study highlights the importance of considering both PDIs and ambient air pollution in understanding the relationships between diet and cancer outcomes. The findings suggest that promoting a healthier plant-based diet and reducing exposure to air pollutants may improve survival rates among patients with OC. Further research is needed to confirm these associations and explore their mechanisms.
