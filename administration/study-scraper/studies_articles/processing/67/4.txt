In conclusion, this study provides valuable insights into the mathematical modeling of ozone-assisted cerium redox process for surface removal and decontamination of stainless steel components. The optimized process parameters identified in this research can be used to design and operate pilot metal decontamination facilities more effectively. Future studies should focus on scaling up the process to larger equipment sizes and exploring its application to other types of contaminated surfaces.
