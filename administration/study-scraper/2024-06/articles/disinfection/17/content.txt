Here are five detailed paragraphs based on the scientific study:

**Paragraph 1: Introduction**
Duckweed has gained attention in recent years due to its potential to be an environmentally and economically sustainable crop. Its benefits include clonal propagation, high growth rate, small plant size, and the ability to utilize the whole plant for most applications. However, efforts to cultivate duckweed in commercial settings have seen limited success due to the largely undomesticated nature of the plant. To overcome these challenges, a controlled environment agriculture setting using vertical towers to maximize biomass production may be the key.

**Paragraph 2: Methods**
To improve and test the Duckweed Production Module (DPM), I conducted five years of trials involving system engineering improvements and growth media management. The original DPM system was scaled from three to six trays, and management protocols were developed to increase harvest yield and production duration per crop. Additionally, a culture-independent approach was used to generate bacterial community profiles from two DPMs, one with intermittent aqueous ozonation of re-circulating growth media and one without treatment.

**Paragraph 3: Results**
The results showed that the optimized DPM system was able to cultivate duckweed long-term and increase harvest yield. Bacterial community profiling revealed significant differences in bacterial diversity between the two systems, with the treated system exhibiting a more diverse range of bacteria. Additionally, colony-forming unit (CFU) analysis showed that aqueous ozone treatment significantly reduced total bacterial load.

**Paragraph 4: Discussion**
The findings suggest that controlled environment agriculture using vertical towers and optimized management protocols can lead to successful commercialization of duckweed products and services. The results also highlight the importance of understanding bacterial community composition in duckweed cultivation, as it can impact plant growth and productivity. Furthermore, the study demonstrates the potential benefits of aqueous ozonation for reducing bacterial load and promoting a healthy microbial community.

**Paragraph 5: Conclusions**
In conclusion, this thesis provides evidence that duckweed can be cultivated long-term and harvest yield increased using a vertical multi-layered platform under controlled conditions when management protocols are developed and followed. The study also highlights the importance of understanding bacterial community composition in duckweed cultivation and the potential benefits of aqueous ozonation for reducing bacterial load. These findings have significant implications for the development of sustainable and profitable duckweed-based products and services.
