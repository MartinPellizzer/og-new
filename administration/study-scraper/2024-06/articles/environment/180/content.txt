Here are the five detailed paragraphs using the information from the scientific study:

**Paragraph 1: Introduction**
Ozone exposure is a significant environmental health concern, leading to lung injury and inflammation. Macrophages play a crucial role in this process by regulating both the initiation and resolution of inflammation. However, the signaling pathways involved in macrophage immunometabolic activation following ozone exposure remain poorly understood. This study aimed to identify the transcriptional profiles of lung macrophages after ozone exposure in mice and elucidate the underlying signaling mechanisms.

**Paragraph 2: Methods**
In this study, male C57BL/6J mice were exposed to ozone (0.8 ppm) or air control for 3 hours. Lung macrophages were isolated and analyzed using RNA sequencing (seq), Agilent Seahorse, and flow cytometry. The expression levels of differentially expressed genes were identified at 24 and 72 hours post-exposure, and functional enrichment analysis was performed to identify the signaling pathways involved.

**Paragraph 3: Results**
The results showed that ozone exposure significantly increased macrophage glycolytic activity and oxidative phosphorylation at 24 and 72 hours post-exposure. RNA-seq analysis revealed significant enrichment of pathways involved in innate immune signaling, cytokine production, cell cycle regulation, and intracellular metabolism among differentially expressed genes. Furthermore, an increase in the percentage of macrophages in S phase was observed at 24 hours post-ozone exposure.

**Paragraph 4: Discussion**
The data suggest that ozone exposure triggers a complex immunometabolic response in lung macrophages, involving both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory/proresolution pathways. The enrichment of innate immune signaling and cytokine production pathways indicates a robust inflammatory response. In contrast, the upregulation of cell cycle regulation and intracellular metabolism pathways suggests a potential role for these processes in regulating macrophage activation.

**Paragraph 5: Conclusions**
In conclusion, this study identified key transcriptional profiles and signaling pathways involved in lung macrophage immunometabolic activation following ozone exposure. The findings provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying ozone-induced lung injury and inflammation and may inform the development of therapeutic strategies to mitigate these effects.
