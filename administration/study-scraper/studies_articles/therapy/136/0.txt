Radiation therapy is a crucial treatment option for various types of cancer. However, it often leads to radiation dermatitis, a common side effect characterized by inflammation and skin damage. The current management of radiation dermatitis involves topical corticosteroids to reduce inflammation, but long-term use can cause adverse effects. Therefore, there is an urgent need to explore alternative treatments that can promote wound healing without compromising patient safety. Ozonated Aloe vera oil has been proposed as a potential therapeutic agent due to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.
