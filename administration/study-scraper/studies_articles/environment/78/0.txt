The Mediterranean region faces significant challenges related to climate change and air quality. To address these coupled issues, a unified approach is crucial. The LIFE SIRIUS project aims to improve urban air quality planning and management by empowering public authorities with the latest knowledge and competencies in urban air quality governance. This three-year project brings together seven expert partners from three countries to develop updated air quality plans for three cities, as well as operational air quality and health-related warning systems.
