The results showed that before ozone treatment, the microbial loads were high, with mesophilic aerobic bacteria, E. coli, and fungi present in significant numbers. After ozone treatment, the microbial loads significantly decreased, with 0 UFC (units forming colonies) detected for coliforms and E. coli at 24 and 48 hours of incubation.
