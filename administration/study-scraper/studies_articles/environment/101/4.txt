In conclusion, this study presents a novel ozone DIAL system based on a single CO2 Raman cell that can effectively measure vertical profiles of lower tropospheric ozone with high spatial and temporal resolutions. The results demonstrate the system's accuracy and reliability, making it a promising tool for monitoring air quality and climate change research. Further improvements and refinements are necessary to ensure widespread adoption and application of this technology.
