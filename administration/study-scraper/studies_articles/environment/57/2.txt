The results of the study show that stratospheric ozone has declined from the 1960s until the 1990s, consistent with increasing ODS concentrations. Since around 2000, ozone has leveled or slightly increased, likely due to declining ODS concentrations. The stratosphere has been cooling, while the troposphere has been warming, in agreement with expectations based on increasing greenhouse gas concentrations. Tropospheric ozone has remained relatively constant since the early 1990s.
