Here is a summary of the study in 1 detailed paragraph, focusing on information and data related to ozone:

The life cycle environmental assessment of a hybrid renewable energy system at Doomadgee in Far North Queensland revealed that PEM electrolyser has the highest impact on ozone depletion, with an estimated 24.87 kg CFC11 eq emissions. In contrast, wind turbines had the lowest contribution to ozone depletion, with just 0.072 kg CFC11 eq emissions. The study also found that wind turbines had significant impacts on climate change, acidification potential, and eutrophication potential, but PEM electrolyser was not a major contributor to these categories except for ozone depletion.
