To assess the feasibility and effectiveness of ozone technology in disinfecting infectious medical waste, a study was conducted using spores of Bacillus atrophaeus as the indicator microorganism. The culture medium containing the bacteria was placed in bags with medical wastes and exposed to ozone gas generated by an ozone generator with a constant dose of 5 grams per liter. The contact time was varied from 10 to 120 minutes, and the absence of colony growth in the culture medium after incubation for 24-48 hours was considered as the success of ozone disinfection.
