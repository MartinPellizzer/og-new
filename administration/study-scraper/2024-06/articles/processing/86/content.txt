Here are five detailed paragraphs based on the scientific study:

**Paragraph 1**
The removal of pollutants from industrial effluents is a crucial step towards environmental protection. Among the various pollutants, dyes are one of the most challenging to remove due to their complex molecular structure and high chemical stability. Acid Blue 113 dye, in particular, is a widely used textile dye that has been reported to be resistant to conventional treatment methods. In this study, we investigated the effectiveness of a magnesium oxide-based nanocatalyst in the photocatalytic ozonation process for removing Acid Blue 113 dye from a dye solution.

**Paragraph 2**
The synthesis of the three-component nanocomposite Fe2O3/MgO/MoS2 was carried out using a hydrothermal method. The catalyst was then characterized and identified using various methods, including X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). To optimize the parameters of the photocatalytic ozonation process, response surface methodology (RSM) was employed using a Box-Benken design. The effects of time, pH, amount of catalyst, and ozone concentration on the dye removal were analyzed.

**Paragraph 3**
The results showed that the optimized conditions for removing Acid Blue 113 dye from a solution with a concentration of 25 mg/L included a pH of 2.27, an amount of catalyst of 8.6 mg, an ozone concentration of 0.2 mg/L/h, and a reaction time of 26 minutes. Under these conditions, the photocatalytic ozonation process achieved a remarkable removal efficiency of 99.3%. The nanocatalyst also demonstrated high reusability and stability, with a retention rate of 92% after eight consecutive cycles.

**Paragraph 4**
The results of this study indicate that the magnesium oxide-based nanocatalyst is an effective and efficient catalyst for removing Acid Blue 113 dye from industrial effluents. The photocatalytic ozonation process can be optimized using response surface methodology to achieve high removal efficiencies. Additionally, the reusability and stability of the nanocatalyst make it a promising option for industrial-scale applications. Further studies are needed to investigate the effects of other pollutants and environmental factors on the performance of this catalyst.

**Paragraph 5**
In conclusion, this study demonstrates the effectiveness of a magnesium oxide-based nanocatalyst in the photocatalytic ozonation process for removing Acid Blue 113 dye from industrial effluents. The optimized conditions achieved high removal efficiencies and the reusability and stability of the nanocatalyst make it a promising option for industrial-scale applications. This study contributes to the development of sustainable treatment technologies for textile wastewater and highlights the potential of nanomaterials in environmental remediation.
