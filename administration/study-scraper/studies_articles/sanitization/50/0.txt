The state of California has developed regulations for direct potable reuse (DPR) projects, which require treatment trains to include ozone and biological activated carbon (ozone/BAC) as pretreatment to membrane-based advanced treatment. This paper presents the process benefits of ozone/BAC pretreatment based on testing at a 3,785 m3/d demonstration facility in San Diego, California. The implementation of ozone/BAC pretreatment has been shown to improve water quality and reduce operating pressures and chemical use for membrane systems.
