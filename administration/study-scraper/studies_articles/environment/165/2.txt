The results of this study revealed a significant association between ozone concentration and total mortality. The analysis found that short-term exposure to high levels of ozone was linked to increased mortality risk, particularly in the morning hours. Long-term exposure to ozone was also associated with an elevated risk of mortality, highlighting the need for continued monitoring and management of air pollution in the Po Valley.
