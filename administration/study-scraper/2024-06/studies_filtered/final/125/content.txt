ABSTRACT

One
 of
 our
 era’s greatest courgesis air pollution, on
 account not only of its impact on climate

change but also its impact on public and individual health due to increasing morbidity and

mortality. There are many pollutants that are major factors in disease in humans.
 Among them,

Particulate Matter (PM), par
ticles of variable but
 very small diameter, penetrate the respiratory

system via inhalation, causing respiratory
 and cardiovascular diseases, reproductive and central

nervous system dysfunctions, and cancer. Despite the fact that ozone in the stratosphere
 plays a

protective role against ultraviolet irradiation, it is harmful when in high
 concentration at ground

level,
 also affecting the respiratory and
 cardiovascular system. Further
 more, nitrogen
 oxide,

sulfurdioxide,
 Volatile
 Organic
 Compounds
 (VOCs),
 dio
xins
 ,and
 polycyclic
 aromatic

hydrocarbons (PAHs) are all considered air pollutants that are harmful to humans. Carbon

monoxide can even provoke direct poisoning when breathed in at high levels. Heavy metals

such as lead, when absorbed into the human body,
 can lead to direct
 poisoning or chronic in

toxication, depending on exposure. Diseases occurring from the
 a fore
 mentioned substances

include principally respiratory problems such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease

(COPD), asthma, bronchiolitis, and also lung cancer,
 cardiovascular events, central nervous

system dysfunctions, and cutaneous diseases.
 Last but no
t least, climate change resulting from

environmental pollution affects the
 geographic al
l
 distribution of many infectious diseases, as do

natural disasters. The only way to tackle this problem is through public awareness coupled with a

multi disciplinary
 a
pproach by scientific experts; national and international organizations must

address he
 emergence of this threat and propose sustainable solutions.

 APPROACH TO THE
 PROBLEM

The interactions between humans and their physical surroundings have been extensively

studied, as multiple human activities influence the environment. The environment is a coupling

of the biotic (living organisms and microorganisms) and the abiotic
 (hydrosphere, lithosphere,

and atmosphere).
 Pollution is defined as the introduction into the environment of substances

harmful to humans and other living organisms. Pollutants are harmful solids, liquids, or gases

produced in higher than usual concentrat
ions that reduce the quality of our environment.

Human activities have an adverse effect on the environment by polluting the water we drink,

the air we breathe, and the soil in which plants grow. Although the industrial revolution was a

great success in te
rms of technology, society, and the provision of multiple services, it also

introduced the production of huge quantities of pollutants emitted into the air that are harmful

to human health. Without any doubt, the global environmental pollution is considere
d an

international
 public
 health
 issue
 with
 multiple
 facets.
 Social,
 economic,
 and
 legislative

concerns and lifestyle habits are related to this major problem. Clearly, urbanization and

industrialization are reaching unprecedented and up setting proportion
s world wide in our era.

Anthropogenic air pollution is one of the big
gest public health hazards worl
d
 wide, given that it

accounts for about 9 million deaths per year
(1)
 Without a doubt, all of the aforementioned are

closely associated with climate change
, and in the event of danger, the consequences can be

severe for mankind
 (2)
. Climate changes and the effects of global planetary warming seriously

affect multiple ecosystems, causing problems such as food safety issues, ice and iceberg

melting, animal ext
inction, and damage to plants
 (3, 4).
 Air pollution has various health effects.

The health of susceptible and sensitive individuals can be impacted even on low air pollution

days. Short
-
term exposure to air pollutants is closely related to COPD (Chronic Ob
structive

Pulmonary Disease), cough, shortness of breath, wheezing, asthma, respiratory disease, and

high rates of hospitalization (a measurement of morbidity).

The long
-
term effects associated with air pollution are chronic asthma, pulmonary

insufficiency
, cardiovascular diseases, and cardiovascular mortality. According to a Swedish

cohort study, diabetes seems to be induced after long
-
term air pollution exposure
 (5).
 Moreover,

air pollution seems to
 have various malign health effects in early human life,
 such as

respiratory, cardiovascular, mental, and perinatal disorders
 (3)
, leading to infant mortality or

chronic disease in adult age
 (6).

National reports have mentioned the increased risk of morbidity and mortality
 (1).
 These

studies were conducted in ma
ny places around the world and show a correlation between daily

ranges of particulate matter (PM) concentration and daily mortality. Climate shifts and global

planetary warming
 (3)
 could aggravate the situation. Besides, increased hospitalization (an inde
x

of morbidity) has been registered among the elderly and susceptible individuals for specific

reasons. Fine and ultrafine particulate matter seems to be associated with more serious illnesses

(6),
 as it can invade the deepest parts of the air ways and mor
e easily reach the bloodstream.

Technological innovation can only be successful if it is able
 to meet the needs of society. In this

sense, technology must reflect the decision
-
making practices and procedures of those involved in

risk assessment and evaluat
ion and act as a facilitator in providing information and assessments

to enable decision makers to make the best decisions possible. Summarizing the a forementioned

in
 order to design an effective air quality control strategy, several aspects must be consi
dered:

environmental factors and ambient air quality conditions, engineering factors and air pollutant

characteristics,
 and
 finally,
 economic
 operating
 costs
 for
 technological
 improvement
 and
