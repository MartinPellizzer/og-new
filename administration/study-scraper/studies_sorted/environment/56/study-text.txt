Abstract
Short-term exposure to PM2.5 or O3 can increase mortality risk; however, limited studies have evaluated their interaction. A multicity time series study was conducted to investigate the synergistic effect of PM2.5 and O3 on mortality in China, using mortality data and high-resolution pollutant predictions from 272 cities in 2013–2015. Generalized additive models were applied to estimate associations of PM2.5 and O3 with mortality. Modification and interaction effects were explored by stratified analyses and synergistic indexes. Deaths attributable to PM2.5 and O3 were evaluated with or without modification of the other pollutant. The risk of total nonaccidental mortality increased by 0.70% for each 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 when O3 levels were high, compared to 0.12% at low O3 levels. The effect of O3 on total nonaccidental mortality at high PM2.5 levels (1.26%) was also significantly higher than that at low PM2.5 levels (0.59%). Similar patterns were observed for cardiovascular or respiratory diseases. The relative excess risk of interaction and synergy index of PM2.5 and O3 on nonaccidental mortality were 0.69% and 1.31 with statistical significance, respectively. Nonaccidental deaths attributable to short-term exposure of PM2.5 or O3 when considering modification of the other pollutant were 28% and 31% higher than those without considering modification, respectively. Our results found synergistic effects of short-term coexposure to PM2.5 and O3 on mortality and suggested underestimations of attributable risks without considering their synergistic effects.
