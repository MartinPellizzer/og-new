Here is a summary of the study in one paragraph, focusing on ozone-related data:

The study explored the association between atmospheric pollutants and preterm birth risk in a river valley city. The researchers found that maternal exposure to ozone (O3) during pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of preterm birth. Specifically, the logistic regression analysis showed that for each 10 μg/m³ increase in O3 concentrations, the risk of preterm birth increased by 2.4% in mid-pregnancy (T2) and 2.5% in late pregnancy (T3). These findings suggest that exposure to ozone during pregnancy may be a significant environmental risk factor for preterm birth, highlighting the need for further research on the effects of O3 pollution on maternal and fetal health.
