The high concentrations of PM10 and PM2.5 indicate that the city's air quality needs immediate attention. The OFP results suggest that benzene and toluene are significant contributors to ozone formation, which is a major air pollution problem. The health risk assessment using AirQ+ model shows that PM10 exposure is associated with mortality from respiratory and chronic bronchitis diseases.
