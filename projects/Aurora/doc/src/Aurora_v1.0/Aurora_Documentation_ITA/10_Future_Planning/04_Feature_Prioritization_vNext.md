## 4. Proposed Features for Aurora vNext

### 4.1 Tier 1 – Critical / Must-Have

#### **4.1.1 Redundant Multi-Point Ozone Leak Detection**

#### **4.1.2 Addition of a Second Ozone Generator for Continuous Sanitization**

**Description**

Aurora operates with a single generator, which overheats after continuous use. This forces downtime periods while the unit cools, leading to interruptions in ozone production. As a result, we are unable to maintain a stable and consistent ozone concentration within the treated environment. The proposal is to add a second generator and configure them to operate alternately. This setup would allow one generator to run while the other cools, ensuring uninterrupted 24/7 operation.

**Business Justification**

- **Operational Continuity:** The current downtime reduces sanitization efficiency and leaves gaps in treatment, which may compromise the quality and reliability of our sanitization process.
- **Efficiency & Compliance:** Many applications of ozone sanitization require stable and consistent ozone levels to meet safety, quality, or regulatory standards. Fluctuations in ozone concentration increase the risk of non-compliance.
- **Asset Protection:** Running one generator continuously to the point of overheating accelerates wear and shortens its lifespan. Alternating two generators will extend equipment life and reduce maintenance and replacement costs.
- **Reputation & Reliability:** Delivering consistent results builds confidence in our sanitization process—both internally and with clients. A more stable system reinforces trust in our operations.

**Expected Impact**

- **Stable Ozone Concentration:** With alternating generators, ozone levels will remain steady and controlled, improving the effectiveness of sanitization.
- **Increased Uptime:** Continuous 24/7 operation without forced cooling downtime maximizes production and reliability.
- **Cost Savings:** Longer equipment life, fewer breakdowns, and lower maintenance costs compared to overburdening a single generator.
- **Scalability:** The dual-generator system provides a foundation for future upgrades, automation, or even expansion to higher-capacity sanitization needs.
- **Regulatory Confidence:** Consistent ozone levels mean easier documentation and proof of compliance, reducing risks of audit issues or penalties.

**Technical Considerations**

- **Generator Integration:** The second generator will be installed in parallel and configured to alternate with the first on a timed or load-based cycle.
- **Control System Update:** Minor programming or control logic adjustments will be required to ensure seamless switching between generators.
- **Safety & Monitoring:** Sensors should be calibrated to monitor and regulate ozone levels accurately across the alternating cycle, ensuring no overshoot or undershoot.
- **Power & Cooling:** Electrical and cooling requirements will be reviewed to confirm system stability when alternating between units.
- **Maintenance Protocols:** With two generators in place, maintenance can be scheduled without disrupting production.
