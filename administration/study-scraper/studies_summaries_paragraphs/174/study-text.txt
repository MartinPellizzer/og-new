Here is a summary of the study in one detailed paragraph, focusing on the information related to ozone:

Researchers explored the effect of ozone micro-nano-bubbles (Ozone MNBs) on "green" and its regulatory mechanism in soybean sprouts. The study found that treating soybean sprouts with 4 mg/L Ozone MNBs significantly inhibited "green", increased activities of chlorophyllase, chlorophyll degrading peroxidase, Mg-dechelatase, and pheophytinase enzymes, while decreasing levels of chlorophyll precursors, including δ-aminolevulinic acid and Urogen Ⅲ. Additionally, Ozone MNBs treatment reduced the content of ADP, ATP, NADP+, and NADPH in soybean sprouts, affecting the substance and enzyme activity of synthesizing and decomposing chlorophyll. These findings suggest that 4 mg/L Ozone MNBs effectively hindered "green" development in soybean sprouts under white LED conditions.
