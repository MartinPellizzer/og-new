To achieve this goal, the authors integrated three models: a machine learning model, an observation-based model, and a positive matrix factorization model. The models were based on four years of continuous observation data from a typical urban site. The machine learning model was used to identify the relationships between O3 concentration and meteorological factors, while the observation-based model provided insights into the impact of transport and dispersion on O3 distribution. The positive matrix factorization model apportioned the sources of VOC emissions.
