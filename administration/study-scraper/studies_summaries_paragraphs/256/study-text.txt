Here is a summary of the study in 1 detailed paragraph, focusing on information and data related to ozone:

This study investigates the impact of land-mass distribution on the atmospheric dynamics of tidally locked terrestrial exoplanets. Using the Earth-system model WACCM6/CESM2, the researchers simulated two TRAPPIST-1e models with N2-O2 atmospheres, with the sub-stellar point fixed over either land or ocean. They found that the presence of orography breaks the symmetry between the northern and southern hemispheres, leading to significant changes in atmospheric transport and chemistry. Notably, peak zonal jet speeds in the southern hemisphere are 50-100% faster than those in the northern hemisphere, affecting meridional circulation and accumulating potentially lethal quantities of ozone at both the south pole and surface. These findings suggest that future studies should consider the day-side land-fraction and orography of the land to accurately model the dynamics of exoplanetary atmospheres.
