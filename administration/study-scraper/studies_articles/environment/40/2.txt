The results showed that O3 concentrations were highest during summer afternoons, with hourly peaks reaching up to 254 Âµg/m3. Spatially, O3 pollution was mainly contributed by background concentrations (34.52%), external transport (34.50%), and local emissions (30.98%) during the case study period. Among local emission sources, biological emissions, industrial sector, and traffic sector accounted for 35.30%, 32.09%, and 23.58% of O3 concentration, respectively.
