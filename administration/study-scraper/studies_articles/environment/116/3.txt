The interactions between elevated O3 and warming treatments were also examined. The changes in the aforementioned parameters caused by E-O3 became less significant or even slightly increased under warming conditions. Warming treatment significantly increased the in situ pushing resistance and basal internode breaking resistance, resulting in a significant decrease in lodging index. This suggests that the rice stem's lodging resistance was substantially decreased by E-O3, while warming partially mitigated the O3-induced negative effects.
