The study suggests that the record high TCO is associated with vertically propagating planetary-scale wave events that caused significant stratospheric warmings during the winter of 2023-2024. These wave events forced poleward and downward ozone advection into the lower stratosphere, leading to record column ozone levels. The study also highlights the importance of understanding the complex interactions between atmospheric circulation patterns and ozone distribution in the stratosphere.
