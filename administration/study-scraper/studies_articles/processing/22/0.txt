Industrial zinc sulfite is a byproduct of flue gas desulfurization (FGD) in power plants. Its oxidation is crucial for environmental protection and resource utilization. Ozone-enhanced oxidation has been shown to be an effective method for improving the oxidation rate of industrial zinc sulfite. However, the mechanism of ozone-enhanced oxidation remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the air oxidation and ozone-enhanced oxidation of industrial zinc sulfite using a slurry reactor.
