Abstract
Atmospheric volatile organic compounds (VOCs) constitute a wide range of species, acting as precursors to ozone and aerosol formation. Atmospheric chemistry and transport models (CTMs) are crucial to understanding the emissions, distribution, and impacts of VOCs. Given the uncertainties in VOC emissions, lack of evaluation studies, and recent changes in emissions, this work adapts the European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme Meteorological Synthesizing Centre – West (EMEP MSC-W) CTM to evaluate emission inventories in Europe. Here we undertake the first intensive model–measurement comparison of VOCs in 2 decades. The modelled surface concentrations are evaluated both spatially and temporally, using measurements from the regular EMEP monitoring network in 2018 and 2019, as well as a 2022 campaign. To achieve this, we utilised the UK National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory to derive explicit emission profiles for individual species and employed a tracer method to produce pure concentrations that are directly comparable to observations.
The degree to which the modelled and measured VOCs agree varies depending on the specific species. The model successfully captures the overall spatial and temporal variations of major alkanes (e.g. ethane, n-butane) and unsaturated species (e.g. ethene, benzene) but less so for propane, i-butane, and ethyne. This discrepancy underscores potential issues in the boundary conditions for the latter species and in their primary emissions from, in particular, the solvent and road transport sectors. Specifically, potential missing propane emissions and issues with its boundary conditions are highlighted by large model underestimations and smaller propane-to-ethane ratios compared to the measurement. Meanwhile, both the model and measurements show strong linear correlations among butane isomers and among pentane isomers, indicating common sources for these pairs of isomers. However, modelled ratios of i-butane to n-butane and i-pentane to n-pentane are approximately one-third of the measured ratios, which is largely driven by significant emissions of n-butane and n-pentane from the solvent sector. This suggests issues with the speciation profile of the solvent sector, underrepresented contributions from transport and fuel evaporation sectors in current inventories, or both. Furthermore, the modelled ethene-to-ethyne and benzene-to-ethyne ratios differ significantly from measured ratios. The different model performance strongly points to shortcomings in the spatial and temporal patterns and magnitudes of ethyne emissions, especially during winter. For OVOCs, the modelled and measured concentrations of methanal and methylglyoxal show a good agreement, despite a moderate underestimation by the model in summer. This discrepancy could be attributed to an underestimation of contributions from biogenic sources or possibly a model overestimation of their photolytic loss in summer. However, the insufficiency of suitable measurements limits the evaluation of other OVOCs. Finally, model simulations employing the CAMS inventory show slightly better agreements with measurements than those using the Centre on Emission Inventories and Projections (CEIP) inventory. This enhancement is likely due to the CAMS inventory's detailed segmentation of the road transport sector, including its associated sub-sector-specific emission profiles. Given this improvement, alongside the previously mentioned concerns about the model's biased estimations of various VOC ratios, future efforts should focus on a more detailed breakdown of dominant emission sectors (e.g. solvents) and the refinement of their speciation profiles to improve model accuracy.

1 Introduction
Non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) constitute a diverse category of organic chemicals. While only a limited number of VOCs emitted to air are known to be directly detrimental to health, they predominantly serve as precursors to the formation of ozone and particulate matter (PM) (Seinfeld and Pandis, 1998; Ait-Helal et al., 2014; Li et al., 2020; Pye et al., 2022). Upon their release into the atmosphere, VOCs undergo a series of photochemical reactions that lead to the generation of ground-level ozone that has well-known adverse effects on air quality, human health, crops, and natural vegetation (Filleul et al., 2006; Hoor et al., 2009; Mills et al., 2018; Li et al., 2019; Emberson, 2020). Concurrently, VOCs also affect the mass, number, and chemical composition of PM through their contributions to primary and secondary organic aerosols (Kanakidou et al., 2005; Kroll and Seinfeld, 2008; Hallquist et al., 2009). Consequently, the reduction of VOC levels remains a critical factor in mitigating both surface ozone and PM pollution.
The spatial and temporal concentrations of VOCs are influenced by a range of atmospheric processes. These include primary emissions from a number of sources, chemical transformations, regional transport, and variations in meteorological conditions. Further, difficulties in emission estimation and model parameterisation of these processes, combined with technical challenges in accurately measuring ambient speciated VOC levels, often lead to varying agreements between the model and measurements (Solberg et al., 2001; Pfister et al., 2008; Veefkind et al., 2012; Huang et al., 2017; Dalsøren et al., 2018; Bray et al., 2019; von Schneidemesser et al., 2023).
Comparison of modelled VOC results with observations presents a number of challenges beyond those of other compounds such as NOx, SOx, or NH3, whose emissions are compiled annually. In contrast, the regular assessment of speciated emission data for VOCs is much rarer. In many cases, emissions are input to a CTM as total non-methane VOCs, but these emissions then need to be converted to inputs of specific species (C2H6, C3H8, etc.) because each VOC has different ozone and aerosol formation potential, and few data are available to support this speciation. Thus, results from models can diverge significantly based on the different VOC emission profiles used. Also, the lifetime of many VOCs is so short that a sound comparison of measured and modelled levels is difficult. Moreover, a particular monitoring site's representativeness of its surrounding air, and the quality of its measurement data, can also vary dramatically. In response to these challenges, continuous efforts have been invested in implementing long-term VOC measurements across Europe (e.g. the pan-European research infrastructure https://www.actris.eu/, last access: 1 July 2024) and enhancing chemistry mechanisms in the European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme Meteorological Synthesizing Centre – West (EMEP MSC-W) CTM in recent years.
A further crucial issue is that real-world VOCs comprise many thousands of species, but chemical transport model schemes can only cope with a much smaller number of compounds, typically in the hundreds. In the default chemistry mechanisms of the EMEP model, EmChem19a (Simpson et al., 2020; Bergström et al., 2022), and the update, EmChem19rc, most emitted VOCs are lumped into different groups (e.g. most alkanes are treated as n-butane), with only a few VOC species having explicit emissions and chemistry. This approach offers the dual benefit of maintaining an accurate description of ozone generation compared to more complex schemes (Andersson-Sköld and Simpson, 1999; Bergström et al., 2022) and promoting computational efficiency. However, it presents challenges when attempting to produce specific VOC concentrations for comparison with observation data.
In recent decades, considerable declines have been observed in those VOCs that are primarily derived from transport, combustion, and fossil fuel extraction and distribution (sectors that were dominant emission sources in the 1990s) due to changes in emission regulation and fuel quality, as well as increases in the usage of renewable energy. Meanwhile, emissions from solvents and the use of chemicals in industry and domestic products, as well as other sources like agricultural activities, are gaining in significance (von Schneidemesser et al., 2016; Mo et al., 2021). These changes in major emitting sectors have consequently led to changes in VOC emission profiles. For instance, there has been a notable reduction in emissions of short-chain non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs) associated with fossil fuels and combustion, and there has been an increase in the relative contributions of oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs) which primarily emanate from solvent usage and consumer products (von Schneidemesser et al., 2023; Lewis et al., 2020; Read et al., 2012).
In light of the substantial shifts observed in real-world VOC emission profiles, our objective is to assess the extent to which current emission inventories accurately reflect these changes. Furthermore, given the significant advancements in the physical and chemical formulation of the EMEP model since the last evaluative studies on VOCs that were conducted in the 1990s (Hov et al., 1997; Solberg et al., 2001), it is important to update our understanding of the model's current performance and identify the factors influencing it. Therefore, the aims of this study are (a) to augment the VOC species set in the EMEP model with tracers for individual VOCs, (b) to conduct a comprehensive comparison of some key VOCs between the EMEP model and ambient measurements, and (c) to employ the model in assessing the “goodness” of speciated emissions, providing insights into their quality and impact. For these purposes, we deployed a tracer method, which allows us to input explicit emissions into the model and compute concentrations of individual VOCs. This tracer method has been used for whole-year comparisons in 2018 and 2019 and for comparisons during the 2022 EMEP intensive measurement period (IMP), as presented in Sect. 3. The methodology is described in Sect. 2.
It is important to note that this work mainly concentrates on VOCs with simpler structures and shorter chains. This focus is due to the greater availability of measurement datasets and emission estimates that underpin the model's parameterisation and evaluation for these compounds, in comparison to VOCs with more complex structures, such as longer-chain hydrocarbons (e.g. greater than 7 carbon atoms), acids, and esters. As more data become accessible, particularly regarding boundary conditions and sector-specific emission profiles, we intend to refine and update the model configuration in the future.
2 Methods
2.1 The EMEP MSC-W model
The EMEP MSC-W atmospheric chemistry-transport model has been developed by the European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme Meteorological Synthesizing Centre – West. It is an open-source Eulerian grid model used for applications ranging from scientific research to policy development (Simpson et al., 2012, 2020; Jonson et al., 2006, 2017; Ge et al., 2021, 2023b; van Caspel et al., 2023). In the default setup for European simulations as used here, the model uses 20 terrain-following vertical layers, with the pressure ranging from around 1000 hPa (surface level) to 100 hPa (highest level). The lowest layer has a height of about 50 m. The model output of surface concentrations is adjusted to be equivalent to 3 m above the surface as described in Simpson et al. (2012). In this study, we utilise the most recent EMEP MSC-W model version rv5 (Simpson et al., 2023), which features a significantly revised photolysis scheme (Cloud-J) compared to previous EMEP versions. As described in van Caspel et al. (2023), the Cloud-J implementation was specifically developed to include each of the photolysis reaction rates (J values) present in the CRIv2R5Em chemical mechanism described below.
2.2 Chemistry mechanisms
Two chemistry mechanisms, CRIv2R5Em and EmChem19rc, have been utilised to develop VOC tracers and to investigate the difference in model performance across different mechanisms.
The CRIv2R5Em chemical mechanism is an EMEP adaptation (Bergström et al., 2022) of the Common Representative Intermediates (CRI) v2 R5 mechanism (Watson et al., 2008). This mechanism is the simplest variant of CRI v2, considered suitable as a reference mechanism in large-scale chemistry-transport models. The CRIv2R5Em also includes a recently developed isoprene reaction scheme (CRI v2.2a) that describes updates to the major HOx recycling routes (Jenkin et al., 2019). A selection of 24 anthropogenic and 3 biogenic species are chosen to represent all NMVOCs emitted in CRIv2R5Em, based on their photochemical ozone creation potentials (POCPs, e.g. Jenkin et al., 2017), abundance, and simplicity of mechanism. This EMEP adaptation (derived from a version based on
