Biodiversity
There are over 1.8 million known living species on Earth of animals, plants, fungi, protozoa, chromista (algae), bacteria, archaea, and viruses 1 and additional species that are not known. The current rate of extinction is debated 2 but generally believed to be substantially higher than the "background rate" before the development of human civilization.

The rate of extinction in the current geological era, officially known as the Holocene and informally as the Anthropocene, is not likely to reach the levels of the five greatest mass extinctions since the Cambrian Explosion but is nevertheless geologically significant.
The five greatest mass extinctions since the Cambrian Explosion, when most modern animal phyla appeared, and the potential extinction resulting from human activity.

Earth's biodiversity is at risk from a wide range of human activities, with agricultural land use leading.
Number of species threatened or extinct by threat factor, determined by a Red List Category rating of Vulnerable, Endangered, Critically Endangered, Extinct in the Wild, or Extinct given by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Many species are threatened by multiple factors. Species are mostly plants and animals, and include some fungi and chromista (algae). Only species assessed by the IUCN are included, and thus there are likely more threatened species not counted. Source: IUCN 16.
Invasive Species
An invasive species is considered to be a species that is introduced to an environment--either through human activity or otherwise--and causes damage to that environment. Invasive species have been estimated to cost the world economy trillions of dollars.

Invasive species are a major factor driving extinctions 18.
