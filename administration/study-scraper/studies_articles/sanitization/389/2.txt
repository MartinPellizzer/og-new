The results showed that exposure to the ozone-containing mixture did not cause pathological changes in the organs and systems of the experimental animals, nor did it trigger a significant stress response. These findings indicate the safety of using this technique in confined spaces. Furthermore, the study demonstrated that the concentration of residual ozone in the room after the therapeutic procedure does not exceed the permissible level, posing no harm to patients or medical staff.
