The results showed that POCP is a useful tool for predicting the ozone-forming potential of VOCs. The study found that certain VOCs, such as propene and hexane, have high POCP values, indicating that they are potent ozone formers. In contrast, other VOCs, such as methanol and ethanol, have lower POCP values, suggesting that they are less likely to contribute to ozone formation.
