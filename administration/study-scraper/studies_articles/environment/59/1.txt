The methods used to measure the TCO were based on satellite data from the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS). The MLS is a instrument onboard NASA's Aura spacecraft that measures the vertical distribution of atmospheric constituents, including ozone. The study analyzed the daily TCO measurements from March 2024 and compared them with the average values for the same period from 1979 to 2023. Additionally, the study used reanalysis data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) to investigate the stratospheric circulation patterns during the winter of 2023-2024.
