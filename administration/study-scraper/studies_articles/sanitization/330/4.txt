In conclusion, this study provides insights into the regulatory mechanisms of QS in response to chlorination and ozonation disinfection. The findings highlight the importance of considering QS in the development of effective disinfection strategies for waterborne pathogens. Further research is needed to fully understand the complex interactions between bacteria, disinfectants, and QS systems, but the results of this study offer promising potential strategies for improving disinfection processes.
