Abstract
In this study, the photocatalytic ozonation process was used to remove Acid Blue 113 dye from the dye solution. The catalyst applied in the process was the three-component nanocomposite Fe2O3/MgO/MoS2, which was synthesized by hydrothermal method for the first time, and then identified by various methods. To analyze and optimize the parameters of the photocatalytic ozonation process, response surface methodology (RSM) was employed using the Box-Benken design. The results showed that time, pH and amount of the catalyst are the influencing parameters on the dye removal, and the optimal conditions for these variables for a dye solution with concentration of 25 mg.L-1, include pH 2.27, 8.6 mg of the catalyst, ozone concentration of 0.2 mg.L-1.h-1, at 26 min. Under these conditions, 99.3% of the dye was removed by the proposed process. In addition, the nanocatalyst showed high reusability and stability (0.92%) after eight consecutive cycles of use in the process. According to the results, the synthesized nanocomposite can be used in the catalytic ozonation process to treat industrial dye-containing effluents.
