Our analysis shows a significant positive trend in daytime IASI O3 concentrations over the past decade, with a mean rate of increase of +2.1 Â± 0.8 ppb/year at the global scale. The trends derived from IASI and CrIS datasets are generally consistent, both globally and regionally. However, some discrepancies are observed over specific regions, such as the tropical Pacific where CrIS shows a weaker trend than IASI. Ozonesonde measurements also confirm the positive trend in O3 concentrations.
