The discussion highlights the significance of this study's findings in understanding the reactivity and transformation of organic matter in wastewater treatment processes. The results demonstrate the potential of advanced spectroscopic methods to quickly and simply assess the effectiveness of oxidation processes. The study also emphasizes the importance of considering specific organic matter variations in actual EfOM samples, as deviations from model substances may occur.
