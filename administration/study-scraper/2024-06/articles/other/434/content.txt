Here are five detailed paragraphs summarizing the scientific study:

**Paragraph 1**
Title: Introduction
The study focuses on peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN), a hazardous secondary pollutant and nitrogen reservoir in the troposphere. Despite its importance, there is limited research on PAN's spatiotemporal distribution, chemical sources, and control strategies. This study aims to address these gaps by conducting one-year multi-site observations of PAN and its precursors in the Pearl River Delta region.

**Paragraph 2**
Title: Methods
The researchers used a combination of field measurements and model simulations to investigate PAN chemistry. They conducted one-year observations at three types of sites: inland rural, inland urban, and coastal urban areas. The photochemical box model with a master chemical mechanism (PBM-MCM) was used to simulate the local PAN production processes. Additionally, the Positive-Matrix Factorization (PMF) model was employed to apportion VOC sources and determine their contributions to PAN formation.

**Paragraph 3**
Title: Results
The study found that PAN levels were significantly higher in the cold season, particularly at coastal urban sites. In the warm season, PAN levels were lower, and local production was dominated by regional transport of inland pollutants. The researchers also observed differences in VOC reactivities with OH (RVOCs) and NOx between inland rural, inland urban, and coastal urban areas.

**Paragraph 4**
Title: Discussion
The results suggest that PAN formation is influenced by both temperature and air mass origin. In the cold season, regional transport of inland pollutants leads to higher PAN levels at coastal urban sites. In contrast, local production dominates in the warm season. The study highlights the importance of considering spatiotemporal variations when developing control strategies for PAN.

**Paragraph 5**
Title: Conclusions
In conclusion, this study provides new insights into PAN chemistry and its control strategies in contrasting environments. The findings suggest that joint control of PAN and O3 is feasible based on their isopleth diagrams. Further research should focus on evaluating the effectiveness of control measures and developing targeted strategies for reducing PAN levels. By understanding the complex relationships between PAN, its precursors, and environmental factors, we can better mitigate the negative impacts of this hazardous pollutant.
