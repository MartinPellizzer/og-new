Here is a summary of the study in 1 detailed paragraph, focusing on the info and data related to ozone:

The study finds that a one standard deviation increase in ozone levels has a negative effect on daily labor productivity in Indian call centers, with an estimated impact of -0.09Ïƒ. Notably, this effect is comparable to the impact of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and carbon monoxide, which have been previously studied extensively. In fact, when considering the total productivity losses across the sample, carbon monoxide is responsible for more than half of the losses, while PM2.5 accounts for less than half, despite being the primary focus of previous research. The study highlights the importance of considering multiple pollutants beyond particulate matter to better understand the impact of air pollution on labor productivity.
