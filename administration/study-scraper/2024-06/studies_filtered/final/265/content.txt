Abstract
At low medically‑relevant concentrations, ozone serves as an oxidant with a wide spectrum of antimicrobial activity and the ability to promote healing and reduce inflammation. Despite providing therapeutic benefits in a range of diseases, certain adverse effects and contraindications of ozone treatment must be considered. These are primarily related to toxicity from inhalation and systemic types of administration and can be avoided by following relevant guidelines and recommendations. Ozone therapy has been implemented in a number of fields of dentistry and the most commonly used formulations for the oral cavity are gaseous ozone, ozonized water and ozonized oil. The biological mechanisms underlying the molecular effects of ozone have been increasingly reported, but currently remain largely unknown. The aim of the present review was to provide an overview of the mechanisms involved in ozone interaction with dental tissues. The present review focused on relevant evidence regarding the effect of ozone on dental tissues, including periodontal structures, dental cells, enamel and dentine, considering in vitro studies in addition to animal and human studies. A variety of biological mechanisms acting through multiple biochemical target pathways were reported to be responsible for the therapeutic effects of ozone. The main beneficial effects of ozone occurred in the following domains: antimicrobial activity, remineralization and microstructural changes of hard dental tissues, immunomodulation and biostimulation of dental and periodontal cells. Additional research could provide further insights into the use of ozone, increase its use for broader clinical applications and assist in the selection of targeted protocols.
1. Introduction
Ozone (O3) is a naturally occurring compound formed from three oxygen atoms as a result of conversion by ultraviolet radiation (1). At low medical concentrations, ozone acts as a powerful oxidant with wide-spectrum antimicrobial activity and the ability to promote healing processes and reduce inflammation through protective antioxidant pathways, thus providing therapeutic benefits in the treatment of a number of diseases (2-5).
The antimicrobial action is due to ozone-induced oxidation, which causes direct and indirect damage to microbial cell structures and metabolism (6-8). Ozone is also involved in pharmacological immunomodulation as it induces mild oxidative stress, which triggers antioxidant responses through the activation of specific molecular pathways, activating anti-inflammatory mechanisms (9,10). Additionally, topical application of ozone has been reported to improve the rheological properties of blood by inducing functional and structural changes at the erythrocyte level, thereby enhancing peripheral oxygen perfusion and general metabolism (11-13).
Due to its strong oxidizing activity, ozone has been used as a disinfectant and germicidal agent for both industrial and medical purposes, with a variety of applications as a sterilizing agent for water treatment, medical equipment, dental settings and closed environments (14-18). Since 1930, ozone has also been studied for applications in dentistry (1,19). However, these studies were abandoned until the 1980s, due to the risk of inhalation toxicity and the difficulty of achieving optimal gas concentrations without dispersion (20). These issues have been addressed with modern technology and appropriate delivery and application techniques (19). A number of parenteral and topical routes are currently used to deliver ozone without toxic effects, with the exception of the inhalation route, which should be avoided due to broncho-pulmonary toxicity (11). The most widely used formulations for the oral cavity are gaseous ozone, ozonized water and ozonized oil (21).
The recommended concentration for a mixture of oxygen and ozone for medical use is between 5-50 µg ozone/1 ml oxygen (11). According to guidelines and good clinical practice recommendations in oxygen-ozone therapy published in the the World Federation of Ozone Therapy's Review on Evidence Based Ozone Therapy (20), an ozone concentration of 5-10 µg/ml is recommended for the application of ozonized products by intralesional injection or irrigation in order to obtain a therapeutic effect with no risk of toxicity, even in the event of ingestion (22,23).
Along with predominantly beneficial properties, the occurrence of some potential adverse effects must be considered, primarily in relation to toxicity upon inhalation. Excessive or prolonged exposure to gaseous ozone, which is more likely to occur in operators than in patients, may cause headaches, vomiting and irritation of the upper respiratory tract, which can manifest as a sore throat, cough, epiphora, rhinitis and bronchoconstriction (24,25). Additionally, certain forms of ozone therapy, namely those that induce systemic effects, are contraindicated in myocardial infarction, hyperthyroidism, acute alcohol intoxication, severe anemia, thrombocytopenia, active hemorrhage and pregnancy (21,26,27). However, ozone therapy is non-toxic to humans and is free of side effects when handled with care, using modern available technology in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions and current guidelines and recommendations (22).
At present, ozone therapy is implemented in certain fields of dentistry, including implantology, oral surgery, periodontology, oral medicine and management of dental caries (28-31). Ozone applications have yielded promising results in the treatment of inflammatory and immune-mediated conditions of oral soft tissues, such as oral lichen planus and aphthous stomatitis (32,33). In addition, ozone has been applied in the context of post-operative wounds and complications such as alveolar osteitis, which alleviated painful symptoms and reduced healing times (34,35). Additionally, ozone has generally contributed to a reduction of possible side effects associated with traditional treatments of these oral ulcerative conditions and surgical wounds and complications (33,34,36). Due to its antimicrobial activity, ozone has been reported to be useful in the management of oral disease of infectious etiology, such as herpetic stomatitis and oral candidiasis (37). In addition, a beneficial remineralizing effect on hard dental tissues has been reported and used to treat dental demineralization and decay (38-41). In particular, ozone application has been suggested as a possible alternative or complementary strategy to manage dental caries in a less invasive and more comfortable procedure than traditional approaches, especially in young or poorly cooperative children (31,41,42). Since dental caries is considered a global public health challenge, especially in children and the socioeconomically disadvantaged population, the implementation of effective, safe and economic interventions to prevent and treat caries should be a priority in oral health care policies (43-45).
Overall, ozone therapy may indirectly help restore functional activities compromised by disease by targeting certain biological processes as a biological response modifier (10). Although ozone therapy is now used in a number of countries, it has mostly been adopted by private health care practitioners (46). Over the past four decades, practitioners in Europe have mainly used ozone therapy empirically, potentially due to a lack of adequate knowledge of the basic principles behind optimal use (46,47). This approach has sometimes led to the inappropriate or dangerous use of ozone, which has contributed to a general misconception of its intrinsic toxicity (46,47). These issues, combined with the difficulty and cost of conducting extensive clinical trials, lack of interest by pharmaceutical companies and health authorities, as well as a lack of sponsorship, have hindered progress in this field of research, so that ozone therapy remains a poorly known and controversial complementary medical practice (47). Nevertheless, a number of studies have been carried out with promising results (2-4,29). The general mechanisms of ozone interaction with human tissues have been increasingly studied and progress has previously been made in this area of research. However, the underlying mechanisms explaining the effects of ozone on dental tissues are complex and are not yet fully understood.
The aim of the present review was to provide an overview of the currently available evidence on the mechanisms involved in ozone interaction with dental tissues underlying the beneficial effects of ozone in dentistry.
2. Literature search methods
The present review focused on the current relevant evidence on the biological mechanisms underlying the interaction of ozone with dental tissues, including periodontal structures, dental cells, enamel and dentine.
A literature search was performed using the PubMed/MEDLINE database (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) until March 22, 2024. The online literature search was performed using combined terms related to ozone and possible biological effects [‘ozone’ AND ‘antimicrobial’, ‘remineralization’, ‘immunomodulation’, ‘biostimulation’, ‘regeneration’, ‘dental cells’, ‘periodontal cells’, ‘odontoblasts’, ‘cementoblasts’, ‘osteoblasts’ AND ‘(dental OR dentistry OR oral)’] (Fig. 1). Among all records retrieved through the literature search, reviews or papers with an experimental design specifically addressing ozone-related biological mechanisms in oral tissues were identified as key references. Relevant in vitro studies, in addition to animal and human studies, published in English were considered, without restrictions on the publication date.

3. General mechanisms involved in the interaction of ozone with dental tissues
A total of 487 potentially relevant records were retrieved as a result of the literature search. The number of studies decreased to 389 after duplicate removal, which was performed using the Rayyan software algorithm (48). Handsearching was conducted by manually screening the references of the considered studies to identify possible additional relevant papers.
The key references considered in the present review are listed in Table I. Of these studies, 16 were in vitro studies, seven were based on animal models including one with an additional human clinical phase, one was designed as a human ex vivo study and one was a review. In the field of dentistry, the main beneficial effects of ozone could be summarized in the following domains: Antimicrobial activity, remineralization through direct interaction with hard dental tissues, immunomodulation and biostimulation of dental and periodontal cells (Fig. 2).
Figure 2
Mechanisms involved in ozone interaction with dental tissues. (A) Antibacterial effect: Ozone causes damage to cytoplasmatic membrane and cell walls of bacteria and fungi, allowing ROS to enter cells and cause functional damage, cell lysis and death. Antiviral effect: Ozone induces conformational changes to viral structures such as the envelope and spike proteins, which leads to virus inactivation. Antibiofilm effect: Ozone induces alteration of salivary biomolecules and related binding sites, thus hampering biofilm formation and adhesion on dental surfaces. (B) Oxidation of the nucleic acids of microorganisms and of pyruvic acid in the oral cavity results in a pH buffering effect, facilitating a remineralizing environment. Oxidation causes microstructural surface changes, removal of surface organic components and proteins from enamel and dentine, which leads to enhanced deposition and diffusion of minerals within enamel and dentin, thus promoting remineralization and reduction of dentine hypersensitivity. (C) Effects on dental pulp: Mild oxidation promotes dental pulp homeostasis, vascularization and regeneration associated with increased expression of VEGF, NO and SOD, which leads to odontodifferentiation of dental pulp cells, odontoblast proliferation and the production of mineralized matrix. Effects on periodontal ligament: Ozone induces proliferation of periodontal cells and enhanced collagen type I synthesis, which results in periodontal tissue regeneration. Effects on alveolar bone: Ozone induces increased osteoblast proliferation and activity, increased expression of osteocalcin and BMPs, reduced RANKL levels and increased OPG levels, which results in the promotion of bone healing and formation. (D) Ozone byproducts and oxidation cause mild ROS signaling and mitochondrial stress, which lead to activation of antioxidant pathways and inhibition of pro-inflammatory pathways, resulting in an anti-inflammatory effects. Ozone also stimulates T-cell mediated immunity. Arrows indicate a causal effect, lightning bolts indicate ozone-induced oxidation and red crosses indicate prevention.

4. Antimicrobial action
Ozone exhibits broad antimicrobial activity through oxidation, which causes dysfunction of the bacterial cell wall and cytoplasmic membrane, resulting in increased permeability to ozone molecules (7). Consequently,
