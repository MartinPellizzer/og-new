This study employed a combination of ground-based observations and satellite remote sensing data to estimate two-decade surface O3 concentrations across China. We used the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model to simulate O3 concentrations at a resolution of 1 km x 1 km. Additionally, we incorporated meteorological variables such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed into our analysis. Our dataset consisted of daily average O3 concentrations from 2000 to 2020.
