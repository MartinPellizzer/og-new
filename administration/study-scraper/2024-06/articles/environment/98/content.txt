Here are five detailed paragraphs based on the scientific study:

**Paragraph 1**
Increases in near-surface ozone (O3) concentrations pose a significant global environmental problem. High-concentration O3 induces stress in plants, leading to visible damage, reduced photosynthesis, accelerated aging, and even plant death. However, its impact has not been comprehensively evaluated due to differences in response between individual plant species, environmental O3 concentration, and duration of O3 stress. This meta-analysis aims to examine the effects of elevated O3 on malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and peroxidase (POD) activities in herbaceous plants.

**Paragraph 2**
To conduct this meta-analysis, we searched for peer-reviewed papers published between 1990 and 2024 using keywords such as "herbaceous plants," "ornamental herb," "grass," "rice," "wheat," "ozone or O3 or elevated O3 or O3 stress or environmental O3 concentration" and "impact or respond or affect or alter or effect." We identified 31 research reports that met the inclusion criteria, including studies on rice, wheat, and ornamental herbs exposed to elevated O3 concentrations. The data were extracted from tables or figures using graph digitizing software.

**Paragraph 3**
Our results showed that elevated O3 levels significantly increased MDA content, SOD activity, and POD activity in herbaceous plants. The effects of elevated O3 on plant membrane lipid peroxidation depended on plant species, O3 concentration, and duration of O3 stress in plants. For example, the wheat SOD and POD activity was significantly lower compared to herbs and rice (P<0.01). We also found that the SOD activity of all herbaceous plants increased by 34.6%, 10.5%, and 26.3% for exposure times to elevated O3 environments of 1–12, 13–30, and 31–60 days, respectively.

**Paragraph 4**
The results of our meta-analysis suggest that rice is more resistant to elevated O3 than wheat and ornamental herbs due to the higher activity of antioxidant components (e.g., POD) in symplasts. Exposure to elevated O3 concentrations for >60 days may result in antioxidant SOD losing its regulatory ability, while antioxidant component POD in symplast is mainly used to resist O3 damage. Additionally, we found that the important factors affecting the activity of SOD and POD in plants were not consistent: duration of O3 stress in plants was more important than plant species and O3 concentration for SOD activity, whereas plant species was the most important factor for POD activity.

**Paragraph 5**
In conclusion, our meta-analysis provides a comprehensive evaluation of the effects of elevated O3 on herbaceous plants antioxidant oxidase activity. The results suggest that rice is more resistant to elevated O3 than wheat and ornamental herbs due to its higher antioxidant activity. Exposure duration was found to be an important factor affecting plant response to elevated O3, with longer exposure times leading to decreased SOD activity. Our findings can provide scientific basis for the study of plant adaptation mechanism to O3 stress under global change and inform strategies to mitigate the impact of elevated O3 on herbaceous crops and ornamental plants.
