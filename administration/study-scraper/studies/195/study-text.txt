Abstract
The consumption of seafood is driven by flavour, yet achieving its high quality remains a challenge for many species reared in recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS). A comprehensive knowledge of off-odour sources in aquatic foods is indispensable in ensuring flavour quality standards. At the beginning of the production chain, early post-harvest lipid oxidation products develop into endogenous off-odours and accumulate over time. These malodours add to those already absorbed exogenously, namely from the water and feeds, although the information on the interactions between these sources is currently scarce. Despite geosmin and 2-methylisoborneol receiving significant attention in relation to fish off-flavour, only limited knowledge on the molecular and ecological mechanisms driving their production in aquatic environments has been reported. Moreover, RAS-hosted bacteria have been associated with a wide range of other odour-active compounds, such as pyrazines, terpenoids, and other degradation byproducts that are frequently overlooked when studying flavour taint in fish. The influence of aquaculture feeds on the flavour of fish flesh has been underestimated, too, both as a source of off-odours but also as a novel modulator strategy to achieve desirable aquatic food flavours. Finally, the influence of water treatment processes widely used in RAS operations, such as advance oxidation process, ozone, ultraviolet and hydrogen peroxide disinfections, is greatly underexplored with respect to odour quality. This article reviews the current scientific evidence with supporting data on the chemical diversity of off-odours found in aquaculture fish worldwide and their potential sources and highlights knowledge gaps that should be addressed in future research.
1 INTRODUCTION
Recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) are land-based and controlled-environment farming systems, resulting from over four decades of research and development in both the private and public sectors.1, 2 The advancement of RAS technology has been accelerated by the rising environmental regulations in European countries with limited access to water.3, 4 RAS are deemed promising aquaculture technologies since they can increase the economic viability of aquaculture businesses by improving production efficiency. RAS allows the control of biotic and abiotic environmental parameters, the stabilisation of production capacities, assurance in high-quality seafood standards avoiding the influence of seasonality, and can greatly expand the opportunities to produce blue foods anywhere on land, such as close to the major food markets.1-7 Furthermore, RAS significantly reduces land and water usage, and permits the upcycling of waste streams into nitrogen- and phosphorous-rich fertilisers.3, 4 As food production systems, RAS are potentially devoid of environmental pollutants, independent of site, salinity, and species restrictions, and are bio-secure.7 Overall, when compared to other fisheries, RAS can produce the highest yield per unit area with the smallest environmental footprint, largely depending on aquaculture feeds and non-renewable energy consumption.1, 3, 4, 7
Despite their productive advantages, RAS are associated with high technological complexity. The success of RAS operators relies on their ability to closely monitor and understand the individual system parameters, from physical to chemical and biological.1 Hence, this multidisciplinary technology requires advanced competences in aquatic biology and microbiology, as well as environmental, electrochemical and process engineering. Additionally, commercial-scale RAS operations require substantial capital investment and high energy consumption rates, which have limited their development and implementation to wealthy nations.5, 8-10 As a result, successful RAS businesses are currently scarce, with most being hatcheries and Atlantic salmon pre-smolt rearing facilities, which operate before the animals are moved to sea cages.5
Bacterial biofilms easily develop in RAS systems. During the continuous water circulation, bacteria encounter numerous surfaces, for example, in the mechanical and biological filters and other water treatment units. After settling on a surface, many species of bacteria produce extracellular material that forms a slimy biofilm, ensuring surface adhesion, protection from harmful water-borne compounds and nutrient trapping.11 Since most RAS systems use natural freshwater or seawater in the production tanks, naturally occurring bacteria colonise the water, despite various in-take water treatment systems. Species that produce earthy- and musty-smelling volatile compounds also thrive among such bacteria.12, 13 Their presence and production of volatiles, in combination with the water recirculation within the system, leads to an accumulation of these odours compounds in the water, from where they are readily absorbed into fish flesh.14 The tainting of RAS fish with these malodours—referred to as off-odour or off-flavour—is considered one of the main challenges of RAS production worldwide, as it leads to consumer rejection and consequently a significant reduction in the marketability of the fish, leading to a negative economic impact on RAS farms.15, 16 Moreover, the prevalence of such odours in cultured fish has created a socio-cultural discredit of these products over the last decades that continues to negatively impacts the development of the sector.17
Given the urgency of the issue and the lack of exhaustive information, this review attempts to compile the existing scientific knowledge on off-flavour in aquaculture-reared fish, with a special emphasis on perception qualities, chemical diversity, and provenance. This article reviews an extensive collection of literature available on odour and off-odour sources in aquaculture and sets out to unravel the current knowledge gaps on aquaculture aquatic food flavour, although the state-of-the-art with respect to sensory-analytical techniques used to study aquatic food odour is not addressed here. A comprehensive overview of chemical classes and subclasses, sensory-relevant physicochemical data, and specific aquatic species or aquaculture-related products wherein most of the off-odours addressed here have been reported, is provided in Table 1.

2 COMMON OFF-ODOURS IN RAS: PART OF A MORE COMPLEX REALITY
Off-odour—often interchangeably referred to as off-flavour—represents an uncharacteristic and undesirable odour that taints the desirable flavour profile of a food. Off-odour taint in RAS fish is mainly associated with potent “earthy” and “musty” notes. These typical off-odours have been extensively described in the literature as being due to the presence of two compounds, namely geosmin ((4S,4aS,8aR)-4,8a-dimethyl-1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8-octahydronaphthalen-4a-ol), an irregular sesquiterpenoid with a potent “earthy, mouldy” odour, and 2-methylisoborneol (2-MIB; (1R,2R,4R)-1,2,7,7-tetramethylbicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-ol), an irregular monoterpene alcohol with a strong “musty, wet soil” odour.15, 36 These odour-active volatile organic compounds (VOCs) predominantly arise as secondary metabolites produced by various microorganisms in terrestrial and aquatic environments, also affecting other foods and beverages, including wine, fruits, vegetables and drinking water.37-40 In RAS, these odorant molecules accumulate quickly due to the highly intensive production and water recirculation.3, 6, 41, 42 Both compounds have a very low odour threshold (OT) in water, reported to be between 4 and 42 ng/L,43, 44 whereby 2-MIB has consistently been reported with a slightly higher threshold in water but conversely in fish. For instance, they can be perceived by trained panellists at a concentration as low as 0.1–0.2 μg/kg for 2-MIB and 0.25 μg/kg in the case of geosmin in rainbow trout fillets.15, 16, 25, 45, 46 Although scattered reports on these off-flavours in fish exist, consistent data on detection thresholds or comprehensive data on how perceived intensities correlate with concentration in water and fish do not exist.47
Commonly, off-odour reduction in aquaculture fish is achieved by “purging” the fish with off-odour-free water. Typically, fish are unfed during purging, thus they lose fat content and biomass at the expense of water usage, energy and precious market weight.48, 49 Starvation periods often lead to metabolic changes after a short adaptation phase, which is first linked to fat oxidation causing the reduction in fat content, and when a critical fat content is reached then shifts to protein mobilisation as a principal energy source, depleting protein mass.50 Costs associated with off-odour in aquaculture have not been studied systematically, to date, but there are some indications of the financial repercussions of affected stock. In the North American Channel catfish industry, for example, over 15% of the potential revenue per kg of fish was estimated to be lost due to off-flavours.29 In the European Union alone, the annual estimated economic loss associated with off-odour in 2015 was reported to exceed € 8 million.51 Besides the direct costs to the depuration infrastructure to combat off-odour and the losses relating to fish weight loss and quality deterioration, there are many substantial indirect costs that have not yet been quantified, such as product inconsistency, labour effort to relocate fish, harvesting delays, market holding periods, and reputation.29
Common approaches for the reduction of preharvest off-flavours is ozonation, advanced oxidation processes (AOP) or ultraviolet (UV) treatments, but these further increase the costs for RAS farmers and their efficiency at a commercial scale across systems has not been validated.16, 52 Moreover, the use of ozone or chemical removal protocols on a large scale can cause toxicity if found above species-dependent exposure levels or if used inadequately for disinfection.53 Innovative approaches in tackling the issue of off-odour are vital to reduce the cost and environmental impact of depuration, which is currently the most widespread off-odour mitigation procedure. Efforts have also been made to remove off-odour compounds in RAS by biological methods. Biodegradation of geosmin and 2-MIB by microorganisms, for instance, has been investigated in several in vitro studies, whereby bacterial species from a wide range of genera capable of degrading geosmin and 2-MIB were identified.30, 54-65 In some studies, degradation only occurred in the presence of a diversity of bacteria, or when supplemented with additional nutrient sources, whereas some bacteria were capable of degradation in minimal growth media with geosmin and 2-MIB as the only carbon source.30, 54-65 Whether these degraders would still prefer geosmin and 2-MIB as their primary sources of carbon in RAS water, where other nutrients are readily available, is essential information to consider, if biological removal of off-flavours is expected to be a feasible approach in RAS production. To the best of our knowledge, however, no studies investigating the use of microbial off-flavour degradation in RAS have been reported in literature. Finally, an alternative strategy to address off-odour might be through the use of feed additives to reduce or mask off-odours in fish,66 although fully viable solutions are still lacking.15, 16
Notably, most studies on unpalatable sensory properties of RAS-reared aquatic foods, to date, have only targeted the above-mentioned dominant compounds of microbial origin.19, 45, 67, 68 Moreover, the potential of the RAS microbiota to produce other off-odours, such as other terpenoids, sulphur compounds, or pyrazines, has been also largely overlooked.69 At the same time, the literature reports a far greater diversity of off-odour compounds of non-microbial origin in aquaculture products and alternative sources and pathways of absorption, thereby highlighting current gaps in our knowledge of the actual diversity of compounds and their origins. Feed-borne off-odours, for instance, have been identified in several farmed species, such as pangasius and tilapia45 and rainbow trout,19 and novel feed formulas have been used to mask off-odours and steer flavour towards more “seafood” and “marine” profiles.66 Nevertheless, data on the influence of feed-borne compounds in RAS species is still scarce. First, the influence of the nutrient composition of the fish flesh, especially the fat content, under different feeding regimes and formulations deserves further exploration.20, 70 Second, if more advanced water treatments, such as ozone or UV light-mediated procedures, are used in RAS, the effect of these treatments on off-flavour in fish requires more detailed studies to clarify potential negative impacts on the palatability of fish flesh.64
3 ODOUR PERCEPTION AND OFF-ODOURS
Physiologically, flavour perception during food consumption is a multi-sensorial experience comprehending (i) the olfaction of VOCs, (ii) the chemesthesis of tactile sensations, and (iii) the detection of the five tastes, that is, sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and umami in the mouth.25 Of these experiences, olfaction contributes the most to the flavour diversity.25, 71 Furthermore, odour-active volatiles exhibit varied OTsi, and while some compounds can be sensed at extremely low concentrations, such as 2-isobutyl-3-methoxypyrazine (OT = 3.8 ng/L in water), others are only perceived at rather high concentrations, such as ethanol (OT = 990 mg/L in water).72
Off-flavours in foods can be described as any odour, taste or texture that cause an unpalatable, foreign, or atypical flavour.29, 31, 73 These are due to (i) the introduction of foreign substances in the food, (ii) the loss of important compounds due to degradation or evaporation, or (iii) changes in the ratios of certain individual components via formation.73, 74 The detection and recognition of toxic and/or spoilage indicators prior to the ingestion of the potentially compromised food items has had obvious survival implications in the evolutionary history of humankind.29 Indeed, aromas, tastes, and tactile sensations—whether consciously or unconsciously—ingrained in the memory of the perceiver dictate whether a food item is palatable or not. As related to memory, also cultural experiences influence food palatability: in a specific socio-cultural environment and geographical context, a flavour can be deemed unpalatable, whereas in another location or cultural setting, within the same food matrix, it may be also considered highly palatable.75 In addition, odour intensity and compound concentration play a fundamental role in defining palatability: several odour compounds are perceived as pleasant only when present below specific concentration thresholds.76, 77 The question thereby arises: when does a characteristic or typical odour develop into an off-odour? It may relate to odours falling “outside” the typicality of food products, even though their perception may change drastically under different social and geographical settings. In this regard, a flavour wheel for sensory analysis of fish raised in RAS systems might be useful as a reference guide to understand the sources of possible off-flavours, which exhibit attributes ranging from nutty (commonly perceived as pleasant) to musty (commonly perceived as unpleasant), although the extent of a sensory impressions might modulate the dimension of hedonic ratings.78 The respective sensory perception, together with the knowledge of odours that contribute to the desirable aroma profile of aquatic animals, can assist in developing innovative strategies to increase the sensorial quality and palatability of fish flesh.
Although flavour and odour are often used interchangeably in the literature,15, 16, 25 the term “odour” will be used hereafter and throughout this review as it is regarded a more accurate definition of volatile compounds capable of eliciting a characteristic smell. Flavour relates to the complex and combined impressions of odour and taste,ii whereby the latter is elicited through non-volatile chemical compounds, such as tastants or chemesthetic substances (i.e., sugars, oligopeptides, or the manifold substances classes comprising bitter compounds); these are not at the focus of the present work.

Food products from aquatic animals possess unique sensory attributes compared to products from plants and terrestrial animals.25 The palatable odour notes humans enjoy while consuming “blue foods” are elicited by a broad variety of odour-active VOCs generated pre- and post-mortem.80-83 Taxonomy and rearing environment also significantly influence flavour qualities in aquatic foods, with the former clearly setting boundaries when it comes to odour in aquatic animals, with notable distinctions reported between finfish, crustacean, and molluscs.25 Bottom-dwelling freshwater, estuarine and river species, both in the natural environment, as well as in aquaculture, are reported to accumulate higher content of off-odours, that is, tench, carp, rainbow trout, catfish, European eel, and so forth84, 85 Euryhaline species have also been reported to elicit distinctive odours before and after the osmotic transition.80
In addition, fat content in finfish species is intrinsically defined by taxonomy. Teleost fish can be grouped in fatty species with a lipid content above 10%, mildly fatty species with lipid content ranging between 1 and 10%, and lean species with lipid content below 1%. Lipids in living fish are commonly stored seasonally, prior to migration and mating seasons. Most species store fatty acids during foraging season prior to mating season, storing fat in intramuscular tissue and/or gonads. For instance, in Atlantic mackerel, fat content ranges from 35% prior to spawning to a mere 5% after mating season; similar percentages are observed in many pelagic species, such as anchovies and sardines.82 As indicated above, taxonomy also defines life cycle strategies, which implies seasonality in fat content and hence in odour generation.82 Yet, other species-specific factors determine odour characterisation, such as fat distribution and composition, muscle distribution and location, presence and/or absence of intramuscular lipid layers, age, sex, and sexual maturation.82, 86
Environmental variables should also be taken into consideration when it comes to flavour development in fish. Rearing environments and their related water quality have been reported as determinants of odour attributes. High concentrations of nitrates and nitrites were correlated to increased concentration of geosmin and 2-methylisoborneol in Grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus) fillets and to significant metabolism dysfunction negatively impacting flavour.25, 87 While temperature is inversely proportional to unsaturated fatty acid content in marine species, the presence of lipoxygenase (LOX)-derived VOCs has been observed to be higher in euryhaline species during spawning in freshwater and in resident freshwater species, correlating with LOX activity and water salinity.80 Therefore, the approximate composition of fish tissues—hence its odour—is significantly dependent on life cycle and biological development, but also by the water quality and fishing area. Besides endogenous flavour development under the effect of the swimming environment, the diet of a species significantly characterises its odour.25, 82 Different terpenoids, bromophenols, and sulphur compounds absorbed from feed ingredients have been identified in several fish species, with both positive and negative sensory influence reported.33, 34, 66 Moreover, water pollutants in contaminated environments, especially heavy metals, pesticides, herbicides and petroleum and polymer-derived hydrocarbons, besides fish health and performance, can also affect flavour quality in several farmed fish species.88-90 Apart from being absorbed by fish in culture, these contaminants can also be accumulated in smaller aquatic microorganisms, such as algae and phytoplankton, leading to a more widespread and thus persistent bioaccumulation within the aquatic food chain.88 This review will categorise off-odours as “endogenous,” typically deriving from spontaneous oxidative reactions, and “exogenous,” as xenobiotic compounds absorbed from external sources (Figure 1).

It illustrates the main sources of off-odours that influence fish flavour reviewed throughout this work. Moreover, it tries to concisely display the main relevant subgroups of odorants found within each category.
5 ENDOGENOUS OFF-ODOURS IN AQUATIC ANIMALS
Endogenous off-odours in blue foods, both farmed or wild species, are primarily the result of the oxidation of lipids due to spontaneous reactions induced by light, heat or heavy metals, as well as by enzymatic and bacterial activity.25, 26 In this review, endogenous fish off-odours are considered as those resulting from spontaneous oxidation pathways and not mediated by allochthonous enzymatic activities, that is, caused by microbial spoilage. However, the synergy of oxidative processes in the development of aromas in fish is a trivial subject to draw a clear distinction between autoxidative processes and microbial spoilage associated with positive or negative effects on post-harvest odour complexity. Nonetheless, whether produced by autoxidation, photooxidation or enzymatic oxidation processes, the off-odour generation reaction chain is similar. Some lipid oxidation reaction markers are very odour-active, while others contribute only a faint smell or are even odourless.82 Generally, it has been reported that fatty fish species primarily develop “rancid” odours, being a category within which salmonids are commonly associated by “earthy,” “muddy,” and “sweet” odour notes, while lean species are rather related to “potato-like,” “amine,” and “sweet” odour qualities.66
Unlike terrestrial species, aquatic species—especially marine species—are rich in fatty acids, particularly longer-chain fatty acids and a far greater proportion of highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFAs). The longer the fatty acids and higher the degree of unsaturation, the more oxidative products can be generated. Furthermore, oxidative compounds generated from HUFAs and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) commonly exhibit low OTs.82, 91 Besides total fat content, fatty acid composition also influences the ability to accumulate other lipophilic off-odour compounds. It was recently demonstrated in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) that increased PUFAs are correlated with lower overall lipid content and higher accumulation of geosmin and 2-methylisoborneol.28 In particular, inter- and intra-muscular phospholipids and PUFAs autoxidative products are more prone to off-odour generation compared to other fat deposits.82 Frequent reaction products have been reported to be aldehydes, such as hexanal, (Z)-4-heptenal, (E,E)-2,4-heptadienal and (E,Z,Z)-2,4,7-decatrienal, causing “rancid” and “dried fish” odours.82, 92 Aldehydes often have a higher impact on off-odour than alcohols and ketones, regardless of their lower abundance.82 For instance, (Z)-4-heptenal has been associated with “fish” odour in cold storage.92 In both lean (cod) and fatty (salmon) raw fish, this compound elicits “boiled” and “cooked potato” notes, but also contributes to “fishy,” “cardboard-like,” and “paint-like” odours when the fish is cooked.82
6 EXOGENOUS OFF-ODOURS IN RAS
The environment in which the aquatic animal lives is a diverse source of odour compounds that can be bioaccumulated and greatly influence its flavour, often negatively. In fact, this is partly why farmed species taste different under different farming conditions.25 Given the commonly reported problem of off-odour associated with RAS-reared aquatic foods, understanding the influence of exogenous off-odours in the overall flavour perception becomes essential for the development of the sector. Besides the perceived bias of an inferior quality of farmed fish being largely disputed, a wealth of sensory and chemical data demonstrates that the rearing environment significantly influences the flavour of aquatic products.17, 25 This phenomenon has been observed in numerous fish species, such as in gilthead seabream,93 greater amberjack,94 bighead carp95 and rainbow trout.96 No clear trend has yet been determined with respect to the characteristic “fish-like” odours between wild-capture or cultured products, but the literature suggests that aquaculture products are more often associated with off-flavours like “fatty” and “earthy,” and contain a richer diversity of odorants.25 On the other hand, wild-capture products are more frequently associated with positive sensory notes, such as “marine,” “crustacean-like” and “sweet.”25 To compete with wild-caught aquatic foods and cheaper terrestrial protein sources in the marketplace, efforts must be made to clarify and control the sources and diversity of off-odours in farmed fish.29 This is especially crucial in regions with long fishery history and seafood consumption traditions, such as in nations bordering the Mediterranean Sea, where aquaculture historically has had a negative reputation.
The bulk of exogenous odour impact in aquatic animals may be summarised based on two factors: first, the food consumed by the animals, and second, the quality of the water of the animals' inhabitat.33 Aiming to shed light on the main sources of off-odours in RAS fish prior to harvesting, the two main sources of exogenous odours, namely microbe-borne and feed-borne, will be focussed upon in the following sections. The processes that lead to their generation, whether chemical or enzymatic, as well as their sensory qualities and implications are described and discussed.
6.1 Microbe-borne off-odours
6.1.1 Geosmin and 2-MIB
Microbial off-odours in RAS have traditionally been primarily affiliated with the “earthy-musty” smelling compounds geosmin (1) and 2-MIB (2), produced by filamentous Cyanobacteria, myxobacteria (Myxococcota), and Actinobacteria (mainly Streptomyces). Their chemical structures are shown in Figure 2. The secondary metabolite 1 is produced through the activation of the bi-functional enzyme geosmin synthase, which catalyses a cyclisation and fragmentation of the sesquiterpene farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) to form 1 and acetone.97, 98 1 can be biosynthesised along several different metabolic pathways: the 2-methylerythritol-4-phosphate pathway has been demonstrated in Streptomyces,99 while it is suggested that myxobacteria use the mevalonate and leucine pathways.100 The three geosmin-producing taxa have been found to share a common ancestry of the geosmin synthase gene (geoA), which is highly conserved across phyla.101 The biosynthesis of the secondary metabolite 2 is catalysed by the enzyme 2-methylisoborneol synthase, which methylates geranyl diphosphate, followed by a cyclisation to form 2.102, 103

Chemical structures of geosmin (1) and 2-methylisoborneol (2-MIB) (2), the two compounds most commonly associated with off-odours in aquaculture.
Studies trying to elucidate the ecological function of 1 and 2 point to different meanings of the molecules both for different higher organisms, as well as for the different bacteria producing them. Some studies report 1 and 2 to be an attractant for insects, offering protection to their eggs and larvae while potentially acting as spore dispersers for the bacteria.104-106 Other studies indicate 1 being a repellent, likely to protect the bacteria from predators.107, 108 Few studies have investigated the influence of 1 on aquatic species. In glass eel (Anguilla anguilla) 1 was observed as an attractant at different salinities, guiding migratory movements towards freshwater.109 Other studies have instead sought to comprehend the generation of off-flavours from chemical or biochemical perspectives. Monoculture studies of specific geosmin-producing bacteria, typically species of Streptomyces and Cyanobacteria, have been performed to determine which environmental settings in a RAS system may trigger off-odour production. In several cases, the results were contradictory, for instance, regarding nitrogen sources. While monoculture studies show a dependency of geosmin production on different concentrations of nitrate,110, 111 studies performed in RAS systems did not reveal any correlations between low or high nitrate levels and concentrations of 1.112, 113 It is also noteworthy that different geosmin-producing species may have a large variation in their generation capacity of 1 and 2. This was shown for 41 isolates of Streptomyces and non-Streptomyces Actinobacteria, which had about 100-fold and 300-fold differences in their production of 1 and 2, respectively. In another study that linked the presence of geosmin producers with water quality parameters in 26 European RAS, it was found that redox potential and calcium concentration weakly but positively correlated with the concentration of 1 in the water, but notably, the concentration of 1 in the water did not have a positive correlation with the abundance of any of the geosmin-producing groups.112 This finding indicates that abundance and growth of off-odour producers might not be directly correlated with off-odour production, and could perhaps be explained by differential gene expression. In Streptomyces,104 it has been observed that the expression of the synthases of 1 and 2 are directly coupled with sporulation, indicating that regulators of spore formation also control synthesis of both 1 and 2. This is supported by previous observations that geosmin production correlated with sporulation in Streptomyces. To our knowledge, studies on regulation of the geoA gene of other geosmin producers have not been performed, yet understanding whether the regulation of this gene is influenced by similar factors across phylogenetically diverse groups would be of considerable value. A recent study points to myxobacteria as being the main producers of 1 in European RAS, as indicated by presence of geoA gene copies in the systems belonging to these bacteria.13 Whether this signifies that species of myxobacteria also contribute significantly to concentrations of 1 in RAS systems is, however, not clarified. It should be noted that in the same study a large proportion of geoA-gene copies originated from a group of unidentified taxa, which deserves further investigation. Clearly, the mechanisms of 1 and 2 production require more attention to better understand the chemical ecology and molecular regulation of the involved genes in different bacterial groups to manage the occurrence of these compounds in RAS.
1 and 2 are absorbed by the farmed fish via several routes. In rainbow trout, 1 was first reported to be taken up leading to the development of an “earthy” flavour more rapidly through the gills and the skin and notably slower via the small intestine and stomach.114 Both 1 and 2 can be distributed by blood circulation and deposited in the fatty tissue, with higher concentrations reported in visceral and subcutaneous lipid layers.85 Passive diffusion from water to branchial surface and skin, active uptake during respiration, and absorption via ingestion have all also been further described.15, 25, 29 The moderate lipophilicity of these two microbial compounds (log P geosmin = 3.57 and log P 2-MIB = 3.31, as reported by47) leads to their quicker accumulation in adipose tissue, while their excretion in water is mostly mediated by passive diffusion and is thus significantly slower,15, 47 although this seems to be species dependent.49, 85 Uptake rate coefficients of these compounds depend on the initial concentration present in water and the temperature of the water,47 as well as tissue lipid content, although the latter is not exclusive, as is evident with the presence of these compounds in rainbow trout.85 Several studies have hypothesised that 1 could undergo biotransformation in the fish liver—a metabolic process that had been previously unknown47—given the net loss of total 1 in the system during uptake/depuration experiments with European eel, rainbow trout and Atlantic salmon.49, 85, 115 This hypothesis was validated in a study exposing grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) to 1, and through RNA sequencing of liver cells from the fish, where upregulation of cytochrome P450 and UDP-glucoronosyltransferase was observed, suggesting that these enzymes are likely involved in metabolism of 1 in this species.116 Moreover, exercise in European eel and feeding in Nile tilapia showed an increased elimination rate of 1 in the flesh (and the ovaries, in the Nile tilapia case study), arguably due to an improved gill exchange efficiency.47, 115 In Atlantic salmon, water temperature had no significant effect in the excretion rate of 1, whereas depuration water exchange did.115
Although the dynamics of 1 and 2 have been primarily studied in freshwater RAS, studies reporting the presence of these two microbial off-odours in saltwater RAS exist.13, 27 Saltwater RAS microbiomes are expected to differ significantly from freshwater RAS, but conclusive data on relative abundance and diversity of 1- or 2-producers in seawater systems is still lacking. Moreover, the impact of salt on off-odour generation and depuration in RAS is still not well understood. One study117 reported a 30% increase in volatilisation rates for 1 and 2 in saltwater compared to freshwater, and a 2.5-fold volatilisation rate boost by aeration as a potential and cost-effective removal technology. Similarly, another study118 showed a significant improvement in the removal efficacy of these two microbial off-odours via ultrasonically induced cavitation with the artificial addition of sea salt (10 g/L) to freshwater RAS samples. This latter observation, however, was not sustained when comparing the ultrasound method in RAS freshwater with seawater systems.118 These researchers consider a possible salting-out effect, but no conclusive data on this phenomenon has been presented, to date.118
Some studies have indicated toxic effects from 1 and 2 to fish. When researchers at study119 exposed hepatocytes (liver cells) from rainbow trout to 1 and 2, DNA damages were observed at 0.45 and 10 mg/L, respectively. Similarly, energy metabolism and motility of young zebrafish embryos (2 h after fertilisation) were negatively affected when the embryos were exposed to geosmin at concentrations of 35–4139 ng/L.120 Oxidative stress in liver of grass carp (C. idella), one of the most important freshwater aquaculture species in China,116 was observed when the fish were exposed to geosmin at 50 μg/L.106 From these studies it is difficult to conclude whether geosmin or 2-MIB might affect fish in RAS. At normal RAS operations, geosmin concentrations are in the low ng/L level (see above) and fish at minimum fingerling size (not embryos) are cultivated. More analyses are needed to decide whether 1 or 2 might influence fish health but considering the present knowledge, we tend to conclude that both compounds appear harmless to fish in RAS production. These findings highlight the necessity for additional research endeavours, aimed at elucidating the toxicodynamic of off-flavour compounds and their impact on the performance of aquaculture species, beyond the well-known adverse effects on flavour.
6.1.2 Other terpenoids
While the production of 1 and 2 is widespread among Cyanobacteria, Actinobacteria, and myxobacteria, many species from these groups also produce a wide range of other terpenes121-124 as well as a plethora of other VOCs, many remaining unidentified.34, 123, 125-127 For instance, bacterial terpenes, such as α-cubebene (3), β- (4) and δ-elemene (5), α-copaene (6), β-caryophyllene (7), α-humulene (8), α-muurolene (9), α-pinene (10), α-terpineol (11), limonene (12), δ-cadinene (15), α-gurjunene (16), aromadendrene (17), all identified in pond-cultured tilapia and pangasius,34 have all been reported as metabolites produced by different geosmin-producing actinomycetes.69, 122, 123 Their chemical structures are displayed in Figure 3.

Examples of terpenoids (besides geosmin and 2-MIB) identified in cultured fish that can be produced by the same bacterial types: α-cubebene (3), β- (4) and δ-elemene (5), α-copaene (6), β-caryophyllene (7), α-humulene (8), α-muurolene (9), α-pinene (10), α-terpineol (11), limonene (12), 1,8-cineole (13), linalool (14), δ-cadinene (15), α-gurjunene (16), and aromadendrene (17).
Biosynthetically, terpenes are produced by different terpene cyclases and the number and specificity of these enzymes can vary significantly across genera.122 Unspecific cyclases can yield very diverse side products via cationic intermediates, which explains the complex nature of microbial terpene biosynthesis.122, 123 Common monoterpenes produced by plants, such as 10 (“pine-tree”128), 11 (“flowery” and “citrus-like”32), 12 (“citrus-like”128), 13 (“eucalyptus-like”32) or 14 (“flowery” and “citrus-like”32) have been identified in the headspace of cultured 1- and 2-producing species, even in Micromonospora olivasterospora, where no other sesquiterpene cyclase other than 2-MIB synthase was identified through genome sequencing.124 6 (“woody” and “spice”95) and 3 (“citrus” and “fruit”129) could derive from the geosmin biosynthentic pathway124 but also, together with 9 (“wood”130), from the action of the (+)-epi-cubenol synthase, another sesquiterpene cyclase of relevance in actinomycetes.122 4 (“sweet,” “fruity,” and “citrusy”131) and 5 (“floral” and “ponkan-like”131) can be byproducts in geosmin biosynthesis but have also been found in non-geosmin-producing actinomycetes, namely Streptomyces filamentosus and Streptomyces sudanensis, as well as reported byproducts of a less conserved terpene cyclase named selina-4(15),7(11)diene synthase.122 7 (“mouldy”132 or “wood” and “spice”129) has been reported as a possible intermediate of the synthesis of carylan-1-ol by the sesquiterpene cyclase (+)-caryolan-1-ol synthase, though the existence of a specific synthase for this molecule is currently debated. 8 (“balsamic vinegar-like”132) was also identified together with caryolan-1-ol and 7 in the headspace extracts of S. filamentosus, but its biosynthetic origin is still unknown.122 15 (“woody”129) was identified besides 1 and other terpenes in bioreactor-cultured Streptomyces citreus133 and α-gurjunene (“wood”134) has been found to be a byproduct of the biosynthetic pathway of the sesquiterpene epi-cubenol.122 17 (“eucalyptus-like”132) has only been reported as produced by Streptomyces spp. in its oxide form, aromadendrene oxide.135
Plant-based aquafeed ingredients have also been reported to contain terpenes,21, 34 thus it may often be difficult to reliably specify their source—feed-borne or microbial-borne—if separate analyses on each individual potential off-odour source are not available. As noted in Section 3, even though some of the terpenoid compound reviewed here have been associated with “positive” sensory qualities, such as “citrus,” “fruit,” and so forth, they still fall within the concept of off-odour used in this review. Here, “off-odour” is framed as any odour falling outside the typically associated with the odour/flavour perception of a given food product. The terpenoids discussed in this section are all xenobiotic compounds absorbed by fish, and the extent to which they contributed to the development of off-flavours remains largely unexplored for the majority of these compounds.
6.1.3 Pyrazines
Pyrazines are another class of volatile compounds ubiquitously produced by bacteria in aqueous environments, and depending on their chemical structure, can be highly odour potent. The odour descriptions of this group span a wide range of possible attributes.31, 136 In many instances pyrazines make a positive odour contribution, as is the case in wine or cheese production, but have also been associated with “earthy,” “musty,” and “green” off-odours in drinking water.136, 137 Alkylmethoxypyrazines (see Figure 4), such as 3-isopropyl-2-methoxypyrazine (18, IPMP) and 3-isobutyl-2-methoxypyrazine (19), which have very low OTs,138, 139 have been a recurring off-odour issue in drinking water due to their “earthy” and “rotten vegetable” impressions.140 However, hitherto only one aquaculture study has reported these as dominating odorants in farmed rainbow trout, where both were identified and described as “pea-like” and “green pepper.”19 IPMP and geosmin were also identified in different aquafeeds for salmonids (see Section 6.2), which broadens the potential sources of microbial off-odours.21 Nevertheless, pyrazines are rarely generally attributed to microbial production in farmed aquatic products. Alkylpyrazines (see Figure 4), such as 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, and 25, are often linked to heat-treated ingredients or extrusion processes used for aquaculture feed production.25 Furthermore, these compounds can also be produced by several aquatic bacteria, as well as several members of the myxobacterial group and the Streptomyces genus,69 whose presence in RAS are well documented. Nevertheless, verifying their formation source, especially for the lower alkylated pyrazines, commonly formed in heat-induced processes, remains a challenge.

Array of pyrazine structures that could be produced by aquatic microbes in aquaculture settings. Pyrazines are also well-known products of heat-treated ingredients used in aquafeeds: 3-isopropyl-2-methoxypyrazine (18) and 3-isobutyl-2-methoxypyrazine (19), 5-sec-butyl-2,3-dimethylpyrazine (20), 2,6-dimethylpyrazine (21), 2,3,5-trimethylpyrazine (22), 2-ethyl-3,6-dimethylpyrazine (23), 2,3-diethyl-5-methylpyrazine (24) and 2-ethyl-3,5-dimethylpyrazine (25).
6.1.4 Other compounds
Cyanobacteria also have been reported to generate many other off-odours besides 1 and 2. Examples are the sulphur compounds dimethyl sulphide (28, DMS) and dimethyl trisulphide (29, DMTS), carotenoid-derived compounds β-cyclocitral (26) and β-ionone (27)141-143 and fermentation-derived hydroxoketones (Figure 5).144 The latter have been only reported to be produced by the species Calothrix parietina and Rivularia sp.144 28, 29, and 65 are typical products deriving from protein/amino acid (cysteine and methionine) degradation, which can be microbe-mediated but also autolytic and therefore catalysed by the fish endogenous enzymes,88 while 26 and 27 result from the oxidation of the norcarotenoids β-carotene and echinenone, which are important photosynthetic pigments in Cyanobacteria. 28 and 29 both elicit unpleasant “sulphurous” and “cabbage-like” notes and have OTs of 7.6 and 0.01 μg/L, respectively.73 26 has been associated with “muddy-musty” farmed fish in several studies.145-147 In addition, one study29 reported that this odour changes as a function of its concentration in water; “grassy” near its OT (0.5 μg/L), “woody” or “hay-like” in the 2–10 μg/L range, and “tobacco-like” when above 20 μg/L. The OT of 26 is one order of magnitude higher than 1 or 2, but it could still contribute to an earthy odour in farmed fish. 27 has also been identified in farmed tilapia34, 148 and pangasius.34 This compound has a more “floral” sensory quality, sometimes described as “woody” and “violet-like.”34, 149 Filamentous cyanobacteria in axenic cultures have also been reported to oxidise 27 into products such as dihydro-β-ionone (“violet-like”149), dihydro-β-ionol (n.d.iii), tetrahydroionone (n.d.), β-ionone-5,6-epoxide (n.d.), and 4-oxo-β-ionone (n.d.).144 In addition, these cyanobacterial types can also produce odour-active hydroxyketones upon fermentation. These compounds are generated via the acetate pathway and examples of degradation products identified are 2-butanone (30, “ethereal” and “fruity”149), 2-pentanone (31, “fruity” and “banana-like”149), 2,3-pentanedione (32, “cream,” “butter”150), 3-hydroxy-2-pentanone (33, “fruity,” “green” and “berry-like”149), 2-hydroxy-3-pentanone (34, “floral” and “dusty”23), 2,3-hexanedione (35, n.d.), 2,3-hexanediol (36, n.d.), 3-hydroxy-2-hexanone (37, n.d.), and 2-hydroxy-3-hexanone (38, n.d.). Even though members of the myxobacterial group and the Streptomyces genus are thought to be the main off-odour producers in indoor RAS, Cyanobacteria can be present in outdoor RAS operations, where these above-mentioned compounds might gain more relevance.

Other odour-active compounds that can be produced by aquatic microorganisms. Particularly derived from the action of cyanobacteria, carotenoid-derived products as well as sulphides and hydroxyketones have been reported as potential off-odours: β-cyclocitral (26), β-ionone (27), dimethyl sulphide (28), dimethyl trisulphide (29), 2-butanone (30), 2-pentanone (31), 2,3-pentanedione (32), 3-hydroxy-2-pentanone (33), 2-hydroxy-3-pentanone (34), 2,3-hexanedione (35), 2,3-hexanediol (36), 3-hydroxy-2-hexanone (37), and 2-hydroxy-3-hexanone (38).
While there is an awareness of the issue of earthy, muddy tasting RAS-farmed fish, the current understanding of the bacteria behind the production of these odours is limited. Controlling this problem would require an integrated understanding of which off-odour producer is present in the system and the biology behind the production of the specific bacteria. Additionally, Cyanobacteria, myxobacteria, and Actinobacteria are prolific producers of a plethora of odorous compounds, other than 1 and 2, which may have been overlooked in the shadow of these two compounds as influencers of off-flavoured RAS produce.
6.2 Feed-borne off-odours
6.2.1 Aromas in feed formulation
The sensory perception of aquaculture products is fundamentally dependent on the effect of the biotic and abiotic rearing conditions, as well as on the diet of the animals, hence on the selection of feed ingredients.152 Aquaculture, and especially RAS, poses the challenge of modifying and controlling both sets of parameters, while maintaining acceptable, or even improved, flavour results.
While water quality parameters in aquaculture are commonly kept at predefined standards to enable fish growth and performance that are comparable to the natural environment, aquaculture engineers and scientists have developed strong knowledge on the feeding behaviour and comprehensive nutritional requirements of species in culture. Until a few decades ago, the so-called “fishmeal” and “fish oils” were the principal ingredients in aquaculture feeds. This changed when the depletion of wild fish stocks and significant losses in abundances of global fisheries steered a swift shift to alternative protein and lipid sources.153-155 The selection of dietary ingredients is not only based on fish growth and performance, but also on market availability, price, and environmental sustainability.156 Consequently, the current array of aquafeed ingredients is far greater than ever before. At present, aquaculture fish are commonly fed on plant-based ingredients, ingredients from terrestrial animals, including also insects, and a wide range of byproducts from aquaculture, agriculture and farming industries, among others.157, 158 Currently, the most abundant fish feed ingredients are soybean meal and vegetable oils158 and the wealth, diversity and power of the fish feed industry is unprecedented, ever expanding and diversifying.
Modern fish feeding trials aiming to improve the production under novel dietary conditions commonly focus on aspects inherent with feed conversion ratio into fish biomass and the effect of fish welfare and performance, as well as on the availability, sustainability, and the price range of ingredients.157 The sensorial evaluation of fish flavour, for example, is an increasing area of research in aquacultural nutrition but has hitherto received little attention compared to other quality indicators, despite flavour being a key quality criterion when rearing fish for human consumption. Humans have historically consumed fish as prey caught in the natural environment, thus having fed on an unmatchable diversity of aquatic plants, algae, and animals. One might therefore speculate that the typical seafood flavours humans associate with aquatic animals relate to their natural food and water sources. Consequently, it is unsurprising that an apparent lack of typical “seafood” odours is commonly mentioned in the literature as aroma deficits in farmed products.29 Substantial scientific evidence currently links several palatable “marine” odours typical of wild-harvested fish to dietary components in natural environments, resulting in highly palatable flavour impressions for consumers.25 At the same time, several studies have revealed the potential unfavourable influence of feed-borne odorants on the sensory properties of aquaculture produce.21, 34
6.2.2 Dietary uptake of volatiles
The dietary uptake of volatile compounds has been studied for decades, yet their impact on overall fish palatability has received far less attention. Most of the ingestion-related off-odours discussed in the literature have been mostly related to microbial off-odours, such as geosmin (1),29, 34 but there is evidence of many other chemical substances contributing to flavour. For instance, “petroleum-like” off-odours in mackerel (Scomber scombrus) were attributed to dimethylsulphide (28) derived from the mollusc Spiratella retroversa.29 Moreover, the presence of bis-methylthio-methane (68) in deep-sea prawns, especially concentrated in the “head” of the animals, was reported as a compound eliciting an unpalatable “garlic-like” flavour.33 Compounds such as this are likely absorbed and stored in the intestinal tract of Porifera and Polychaetes and other sessile taxa the prawns feed on. Its formation pathway in these organisms is still unknown, but it has been proposed to derive from cysteine and trimethylamine oxide.159 Interestingly, feed ingredients also have the potential to modulate the presence of traditional off-odours in aquaculture. Reducing feed phosphorous down to 4–6 g/kg was reported to cause a significant drop in the concentration of 1 both in RAS-reared rainbow trout and water.160 It was hypothesised that the decrease was due to a reduction in the excretion of orthophosphate, known to be a nutritional source for cyanobacteria and some non-photosynthetic microorganisms associated with the production of 1 in RAS.160 Likewise, the influence of commercial feed ingredients on the formation of odours in aquaculture fish has been reported in a handful of publications, but direct correlations between odours in fish feed ingredients and off-odours in seafood have not been demonstrated, to date. Barramundi fed with meat-based diets was reported to have higher contents of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids and oxidative products.161 Vegetable oils were associated with hexanal (39, “green,” “grassy”), (E)-2-hexenal (40, “moss-like,” “mushroom-like”) and 2-nonanol (46, “moss-like,” “fresh”) in brown trout,162 while increased off-odour levels were observed in tench (Tinca tinca L.) flesh when fed with soybean oils that were rich in n-6 fatty acids163; the chemical structures of the lipid oxidation-derived off-odour compounds are depicted in Figure 6. In addition, even though 28 and other sulphur-containing compounds in dietary components have traditionally been described as “sulphury” and “garlic-like,” they have been described as palatable “marine” odours in other studies.25

Lipid oxidation products are common odours that can turn into off-odours in RAS fish. These compounds can originate from endogenous fat tissue but also derive from the lipid sources used in the feed formulation.
A few recent studies have described the absorption of off-odours from aquaculture feeds, yet most did not employ olfactometric analyses.25, 34, 36 Feed-borne terpenes in pond-reared tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) and pangasius (Pangasianodon hypophthalmus) were reported to influence fish flesh off-odour. Seven terpenes were identified in aquafeeds, five of which—9, 10, 12, 63, 64—were present in the fish meat. Based on literature data, three of these compounds elicit “woody” and “pine-like” off-odours, and feed-derived limonene and α-pinene were suggested to have accumulated at concentrations sufficient to provoke “woody” taints. Nonetheless, the chemical assessment was semi-quantitative and did not involve olfactometry, the latter being a key technique to detect the odour impact of compounds not detectable by mass spectrometry. One study21 employed odour intensity analyses and reported four commercial feeds to be the source of several off-odours in rainbow trout. 1 and other distinctive off-odours (see Figures 6 and 8), such as skatole (71, “faecal”), cresols (ortho- (72), para- (73) and meta- (74)) (“horse-stable-like, faecal”) and indole (70, “sweaty”) were recorded in all feeds and fish flesh. Other potent odorants recorded were pyrazines, such as 18, 20, and 22 (“roast-like” and “earthy” odours), α-androst-16-en-3-one (75, “sweat-like”) and (E,Z,Z)-2,4,7-decatrienal (53, “metallic”). An evaluation of the free fatty acid profiles of the commercial feeds revealed a relationship to off-odours, while the total fat content of the feeds was negligible. It was suggested in that study that the dominant off-odours were likely derived from lipid oxidation products of plant-based ingredients and lard oil more than fishmeal and oil. Based on total content of saturated fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), the feed containing the highest presumed amount of fish oils caused the fewest off-odours in fish and positively correlated with pleasant “green,” “grassy,” and “geranium-like” sensory notes. Notably, the odour intensity was attributed not only to oil sources but also to proteins, with fishmeal eliciting more distinctive smells than plant-based proteins. Consequently, it was also proposed that the feed protein sources influence aroma intensity and diversity in farmed fish.21 In view of these results, assessing the aroma profile of raw ingredients and recording the generation of off-odours during their processing, extrusion and storage would be important to further narrow down the ingredient sources of off-odour and the chemical processes involved in their formation.
6.2.3 Lipid oxidation products in feeds
HUFA and PUFA are well-known sources of volatile aldehydes in feed manufacturing processes.164 The choice of dietary lipid source, content and composition is a significant factor shaping the odour composition of fish fillets.20, 163 Omega 3-fatty acids, for instance, are precursors of odour in fish, and their fatty acid composition directly corresponds to that ingested from the diet.163 A recent review25 reported that several studies have demonstrated significant correlations between oxidative products of feed oils and overt “fatty” and “fish-like” off-odours in farmed aquatic foods. Moreover, oxidation-derived off-odours from raw materials can accumulate in extruded feed over time when not adequately balanced by antioxidants and stored in a warm environment.165 These compounds are then absorbed in adipose tissue at concentrations dependent on their octanol/water partitioning coefficient (log P). Volatile oxidative products of various oil types were described to elicit similar taints in fish; these are primarily isomeric dienals (log P between 1 and 4), but also other compounds exceeding a log P of 4, such as nonanal (45), decanal (50), hexadecanal (54), hexadecanoic acid (55), and so forth (see Figure 6).25 Plant oils were often correlated with “fatty” and “fish-like” off-odours when replacing fish oils, for example, palm or soybean oil-derived 45, 39, (E)-2-octenal (43), (E)-2-decenal (51), (E,E)-2,4-decadienal (52), and other n-6 fatty acids were responsible for dominant off-odours in farmed tench163 and gilthead seabream.166 Nonetheless, also fish-derived n-3 fatty acids were described to generate off-odours in the form of aldehydes, ketones, and alcohols.24 Marine oils from microalgae sources were found to ubiquitously elicit “fishy” off-odours derived from the oxidation of DHA and EPA, with heptanal (41) and (E,Z)-3,5-octadien-2-one (44) (see Figure 6) standing out among all lipid oxidation products identified.167
6.2.4 Flavour enhancement with bromophenols and sulphurous compounds
In the scientific literature, the use of alternative lipid and protein sources has been also reported to exert beneficial effects on aquaculture products, such as positive changes in fish flesh texture, pigmentation, and aroma.152 Pertaining to fillet quality in salmonids, feed formulation and additives, carotenoids have been shown to impact firmness, fat content and colouration.157 However, employing specific feed-borne odorants to mask others and ultimately ameliorate the flavour quality of aquaculture products is a highly complex task, as it is not only species dependent but also related to regional market preferences and the aquaculture systems in use. For instance, several studies have reported “iodine-like,” “marine,” “crustacean-like,” “sweet” aromas in aquaculture species when exposed to bromophenols and sulphur-based volatile compounds typical of microalgae.25, 29, 66, 152, 168 Both bromophenols and DMS are widely reported to have beneficial effects when fed as microalgae to carnivorous fish.169 Bromophenols (see Figure 7), principally 2,6-dibromophenol (59) and its precursors, are synthesised by marine algae and are absorbed into animal tissue and bioaccumulated over time.25, 33, 168, 170 Herbivore, filter feeding and omnivore grazing marine taxa, such as bryozoans, molluscs, and polychaetes, are known to obtain several “marine” and “crustacean-like” odours by consuming marine microalgae.25 Some experimental studies have demonstrated a successful flavour enrichment with “marine,” “crustacean-like,” “sweet” aromas in aquaculture produce by supplementing diets with microalgae-derived compounds, such as 2-bromophenol (56, “shrimp-like”168), 4-bromophenol (57, “phenolic-like”171), 2,4-dibromophenol (58, “phenolic-like”171), 2,6-dibromophenol (59, “iodine-,” “iodoform-like”171) and 2,4,6-tribromophenol (60 “shrimp-like”168). This is the case of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas acquiring 3-nonyne (49, “cucumber-like,” “marine-like”), 6-(E)-nonen-1-ol (47, “green,” “fresh”) and 4-ethylbenzaldehyde (76, “anise-like”) from T. isocrhrysis andIsochrys galbana and (3E,6Z)-nona-3,6-dien-1-ol (48) from several other taxa.25, 172 Another study168 also reported the “marine” odour (also described as “sea-like,” “brine-like,” or “iodine-like”) modulation capability of bromophenols in wild compared with farmed Atlantic salmon, in which “sea-like” attributes disappeared as feeding ceased during mating season. In addition, a total bromophenol content (TBC) varying between 9.5 and 1114 ng/g was correlated to palatable attributes in wild-caught prawns, with sensory impressions of “ocean-like” and “prawn-like,” whereas the farmed P. monodon was described as “bland” when exhibiting a TBC below 1 ng/g171; it was highlighted that the main difference between the investigated products was their diet. The formation mechanism of bromophenols is still greatly unknown, but bromoperoxidases, bromase, laccase, hydrogen peroxide, and bromide are deemed to be involved in their biosynthesis.173 Also, L-tyrosine is speculated to be a probable precursor of simple bromophenols, but no conclusive evidence was found in the literature.33, 174 By comparison, off-odours have been also reported in relation to bromine-containing phenols, eliciting “iodoform-like” odours in several species of crustaceans and molluscs.33, 168 Some studies demonstrate how these compounds may cause fewer desirable qualities when exceeding set thresholds or when evaluated in water, confirming the importance of the food matrix and compound concentrations in defining the hedonic tone of an odour quality.33, 86 Nevertheless, some studies highlighted the sub-lethal and lethal effects of brominated phenols and indoles of biogenic origin in zebrafish.175, 176 These secondary metabolites were suggested to be produced for antimicrobial, antifungal, and other allelopathic interactions in marine microalgae and polychaetes, and their EC50iv ranges between 4.3 mg/L for 4-bromoindole and 60.7 mg/L for 3-bromophenol in zebrafish embryos.173, 175

Diverse bromide-containing compounds, namely bromophenols and bromoanisoles, have been reported to have flavour-modulating properties in aquatic foods. In the figure: 2-bromophenol (56), 4-bromophenol (57), 2,4-dibromophenol (58), 2,6-dibromophenol (59), 2,4,6-tribromophenol (60), 2,4-dibromoanisole (61), and 2,4,6-tribromoanisole (62).
Other microalgae-derived compounds (see Figures 7 and 8) can improve odours of aquaculture fish flesh when provided through dietary means, such as methylsulphonylmethane (69), 2,4-dibromoanisole (61), 2,4,6-tribromoanisole (62), and dimethylsulphide (28).25 Feeds integrated with ≥20% Ulva ohnoi were reported to significantly enhance the “crab-like,” “sweet,” “marine” and “seafood” impressions in farmed Barramundi without compromising feed acceptance or palatability.66 The expected bromophenols were not identified in the fillets and, instead, 28 was argued to be the key compound behind these flavour changes.66 Optimum inclusion level is deemed algae and fish species dependent as well, but more studies are needed on this front. DMS (28) can be produced via cleavage—enzymatic or heat-mediated—of dimethylsulfoniopropionate, a compound produced by marine algae, bacteria and possibly other marine organisms, absorbed by a diverse range of filter feeder and grazing molluscs through feeding and breathing, and then bioaccumulated in fish, such as salmonids, and cods in shallow waters.33 28 has a low OT of 0.33 ng/g in water177 and can elicit palatable “marine” odours below set concentration thresholds, but it has been also reported as “petroleum-like,” “cabbage-like” and “garlic-like,” likely when present at much higher concentrations.33 In fact, several sulphur compounds, such as hydrogen sulphide (65), methanethiol (66), 28, DMDS (67) and 29 have mostly been associated with “putrid” and “cabbage-like” notes in many foods and are commonly linked to protein degradation, microbial growth, and spoilage.82

Other off-odours reported in cultured fish identified in feed sources. These can be chemically very diverse, ranging from terpenoids to small sulphur-containing compounds, phenols, and indoles. Depicted in the figure: p-cimene (63), longifolene (64), hydrogen sulphide (65), methanethiol (66), dimethyldisulphide (67), bis-methylthio-methane (68), methylsulphonylmethane (69), indol (70), skatole (71), o-cresol (72), p-cresol (73), m-cresol (74), α-androst-16-en-3-one (75), 4-ethylbenzaldehyde (76).
6.2.5 Final considerations on off-odour mitigation via feeds
The lipophilicity of exogenous compounds eliciting palatable seafood odours could guide feed manufacturers in selecting suitable candidates to optimise flavour. Most of the compounds associated with a “marine” odour impression exhibit a range of log P values from 0.9 to 3.7 and are therefore suitable for enhancing flavour by bioaccumulation in fish flesh. Besides lipophilicity, the supplementation strategy and synergies of multiple odours should be considered. For example, a synergistic effect between the lipid oxidation products 41 and 44 was reported to elicit the characteristic “fishy” off-odour in algal marine oils.167 Odour compounds with log P values above 4, as in the case of 45 and 50, can over-accumulate in animal tissue and elicit overt “fish-like” and “fatty” notes compared with compounds with lower log P values (0–3), such as bromophenols, which are unlikely to over-accumulate from the diet. This deserves closer attention, given the importance of log P values—together with fat content—as bioaccumulation predictors in fish.178 Moreover, odour bioaccumulation and modulation through feed is a topic largely unexplored in aquaculture research.
Finally, recent work has highlighted the possibility of increasing off-flavour displacement from fatty tissue storage and excretion via respiration by providing high lipid content feeds.85, 179 Geosmin (1) was reported to be successfully eliminated in fed tilapia compared with starved tilapia.179 In the latter study, a significant difference in lipid blood levels between the fed and non-fed fish was observed, indicating a significantly faster elimination of 1 in the former compared to the latter group. This observation was motivated by the greater capacity of blood to displace 1 from flesh (non-significant) and from ovaries (significant) and transport it out into water. Feeding may affect elimination of 1 in two ways: by increasing ventilation due to more oxygen needed during thermogenesis and/or by increasing the lipoproteins and lipids in the plasma, hence concentrating more 1 in the circulatory system. Improving excretion of unpalatable exogenous odour-active compounds through dietary means is a novel research opportunity with numerous potential benefits.
7 CONCLUSIONS
Sustainable aquaculture plays a crucial role in ensuring a steady supply of aquatic foods in sufficient quantities to meet consumer demands and help restore the overexploited aquatic ecosystems worldwide. Among various systems, RAS hold great potential due to their high production capacity. Despite many benefits of this farming approach, there remains a degree of scepticism towards RAS-derived fish among consumers, partly due to associations with off-flavours. Recirculation in RAS can lead to off-odours in reared aquatic foods that greatly hinder the sector development and expansion. A full understanding of potential off-odour sources is necessary to enable quality amelioration strategies to be established, thus a more comprehensive approach to study related issues is required. First, pre-harvest off-odours developed from endogenous sources need greater consideration, given both their direct and indirect influence on off-odour development. Second, an effective mitigation of well-documented microbial off-odours, such as geosmin and 2-MIB, demands a deeper understanding of the molecular and ecological causes leading to their production. In addition, considering the plethora of odour-active metabolites produced by RAS-related bacteria, other terpenoids, pyrazines, and degradation products should not be overlooked as potential off-odours in the pursuit of optimising farmed fish flavour quality. Third, the significance of feed as both a source of off-odours and an odour modulator in aquaculture merits closer attention, given the notable influence of feed-borne odours reported in farmed aquatic species. Feeds can be formulated not only to optimise growth and welfare but also to streamline desirable flavour characteristics, and the development of flavour-enhancing finishing diets could be a cost-effective alternative for RAS farmers with off-odour issues that could obviate the need for depuration. Moreover, organic load-reducing processes as well as the usage of products to enhance microbial stability in RAS, such as AOP, ozone, UV, hydrogen peroxide, peracetic acid, and so forth, could also be a source of odours largely underexplored. Research efforts should also consider these in the future.
