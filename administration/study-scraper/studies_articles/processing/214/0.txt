Refractory gold ore is a challenging type of gold ore that is difficult to process using conventional cyanidation methods. To improve gold recovery from sulfide-type refractory ores, pre-oxidation using ozone gas has been proposed as a potential pre-treatment method. The use of ozone gas for pre-oxidation can help break down the mineral structure and make the gold more accessible to extraction. This study aimed to investigate the effect of direct and indirect pre-oxidation using ozone gas on the gold extraction in the cyanidation process.
