Here are five detailed paragraphs summarizing the scientific study:

**Paragraph 1**
Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have gained significant attention due to their simple manufacturing process and unique optoelectronic properties. Their reversible electrical or optical properties changes in response to oxidizing or reducing environments make them prospective materials for gas detection technologies. Despite advancements in perovskite-based sensor research, the mechanisms behind perovskite-gas interactions are still unclear. This study aims to optimize a perovskite-based room temperature ozone sensor by evaluating the sensing performance and long-term stability of MHPs.

**Paragraph 2**
The researchers employed a multifaceted approach to investigate the optimization of the perovskite-based room temperature ozone sensor. The study involved varying halide composition and Mn doping levels to examine their impact on the sensor's performance. The authors also conducted atomistic simulations to support experimental findings. Furthermore, they performed long-term evaluations of the sensors to provide valuable insights into evolving sensing behaviors.

**Paragraph 3**
The results revealed a clear correlation between halide composition and sensing behavior. Specifically, Br-rich sensors displayed a p-type response to O3 gas, while Cl-based counterparts exhibited an n-type sensing behavior. Notably, Mn-doping significantly enhanced the O3 sensing performance by facilitating the gas adsorption process. The study also found that long-term evaluation of the sensors highlighted the impact of dynamic instabilities over time.

**Paragraph 4**
The findings suggest that optimal halide combination and Mn-doping levels are crucial for engineering high-performing, durable perovskite-based gas sensors. The study's results provide valuable insights into understanding the mechanisms behind perovskite-gas interactions, which is essential for optimizing sensor performance. Moreover, the authors' approach can be extended to other gas sensing applications, potentially leading to the development of more effective and efficient sensors.

**Paragraph 5**
In conclusion, this research offers a significant step forward in engineering room temperature perovskite-based gas sensors that are not only low-cost and high-performing but also durable. The study's findings demonstrate the importance of optimizing halide composition and Mn-doping levels to achieve optimal sensing performance. Furthermore, the authors' multifaceted approach can be applied to other research areas, potentially leading to breakthroughs in sensor technology.
