In conclusion, this study provides new insights into the complex interaction between ozone and the autoxidation of 1-hexene over a wide temperature range. The combination of synchrotron-based photoelectron spectroscopy and chemical ionization mass spectrometry allowed for the detection of highly oxygenated organic molecules, which play a significant role in air quality. These findings have important implications for understanding the chemistry of atmospheric and combustion regimes and highlight the importance of considering ozone-initiated oxidation pathways in these systems.
