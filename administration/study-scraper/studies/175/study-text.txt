Abstract
Air pollution exposure is linked to an increased risk of stroke. Elevated levels of pollution (carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, sulfur dioxide, coarse particulate matter [PM10], and especially fine particulate matter [PM2.5]) cause systemic inflammation after the particles are inhaled and lodge into lung tissue, causing an increased incidence of stroke, hospitalizations for stroke, and stroke mortality. Until air pollution levels are remediated, assessing Air Quality Index (AQI) and following the guidelines to decrease illness from exposure is imperative. AQI levels are reported hourly, identifying ambient PM2.5 and ozone levels. When AQI levels are low, the risk of exposure to PM2.5 is low. As the AQI increases, there is more risk. It is important to take steps to decrease exposure to PM2.5, especially for those with cardiovascular comorbidities such as diabetes and those with previous stroke events. This is important information for nurses to understand and share with their patients as a risk reduction strategy.
