Tropospheric ozone (O3) is a significant air pollutant that has detrimental effects on human health, plant life, and climate. Its formation involves complex photochemical reactions primarily driven by precursor gases such as oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Understanding the mechanisms and quantification of O3 formation is crucial for developing effective strategies to mitigate its adverse impacts on air quality and human health.
