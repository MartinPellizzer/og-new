To achieve this goal, researchers conducted direct ozone production rate (OPR) measurements in Lhasa in June 2021, using a twin-chamber system optimized for high-altitude environments. They compared the findings to those from similar climatic conditions in Beijing, another Chinese city with significant O3 pollution issues. Additionally, they employed advanced chemical and physical models to simulate the ozone formation process and evaluate the sensitivity of OPR to different precursor emissions.
