The study employed a combination of satellite and ground-based data to retrieve trace gas concentrations and aerosol products, including ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and ammonium nitrate. Satellite data from the European Space Agency's (ESA) Envisat and Terra satellites were used to estimate column-integrated concentrations of these gases, which were then validated using ground-based reference data. Emissions of trace gases relevant to AQ were determined using satellite data and models.
