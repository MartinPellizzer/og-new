**Paragraph 1**
Heat-related mortality is a significant public health concern globally. Shandong Province in China has experienced increasingly frequent and severe heatwaves, posing a threat to residents' lives. Understanding the relationship between air pollutants and heat-related mortality is essential for developing effective healthcare strategies. A recent study published in the American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene investigated whether the associations of hot temperatures with daily mortality were modified by different air pollutant levels in Shandong Province.

**Paragraph 2**
The study used a time-stratified case-crossover model to analyze daily data of air pollutants, meteorological factors, and mortality from 2013 to 2018. The researchers collected data on particulate matter with different particle sizes (PM1, PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone, and other variables. An interaction term was used to examine the modification effect of air pollutants on heat-mortality associations during hot seasons.

**Paragraph 3**
The study found that extreme heat increased mortality risk by a cumulative odds ratio of 3.66 over 0-10 days. The researchers discovered that the mortality risk during hot seasons was stronger at high air pollutant levels, particularly for particulate matters with smaller aerodynamic diameters. Females and older adults (over 75 years) were found to be more vulnerable to the modification effect of air pollutants.

**Paragraph 4**
The results suggest that very fine particles (<1 Î¼m in diameter) and NO2 have a significant impact on heat-related mortality, especially for cardiorespiratory disease. The study highlights the importance of considering the combined effect of air pollution and ambient heat when developing healthcare strategies. Furthermore, women and older adults should be given priority in health-related settings due to their increased vulnerability.

**Paragraph 5**
In conclusion, this study provides valuable insights into the modification effect of air pollutants on heat-related mortality in Shandong Province, China. The findings emphasize the need for tailored healthcare approaches that account for the interaction between air pollution and ambient temperature. By acknowledging these interactions, policymakers can develop effective strategies to mitigate the impacts of heatwaves and improve public health outcomes.
