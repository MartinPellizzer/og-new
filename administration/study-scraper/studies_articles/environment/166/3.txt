The results of this study support previous findings on the increasing trend of tropospheric ozone in the past decade. The consistency between IASI and CrIS datasets provides confidence in the satellite-derived trends, which can complement in situ measurements. However, uncertainties remain due to differences in instrument sensitivities and calibration. Further studies are needed to better understand the drivers of O3 trends and their implications for atmospheric chemistry.
