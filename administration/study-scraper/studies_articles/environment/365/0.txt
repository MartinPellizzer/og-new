Air quality forecasting is a crucial tool used by environmental managers to mitigate the adverse health effects of air pollutants. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has developed an online-coupled air quality model (AQM) forecast system within the Unified Forecast System (UFS) framework. This study presents the latest development of the next-generation regional air quality model (AQM) forecast system, which incorporates the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model as its main chemistry component. The updates aim to enhance both computational efficiency and the representation of air-surface exchange processes.
