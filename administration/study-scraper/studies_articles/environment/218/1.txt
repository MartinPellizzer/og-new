The authors employed the Department of Energy's Energy Exascale Earth System Model version 2 (E3SMv2) to simulate natural QBO cycles in winds, temperature, and ozone. The E3SMv2 is a comprehensive climate model that accounts for various atmospheric and oceanic processes. The authors used linearized stratospheric ozone chemistry to isolate the temperature-driven changes from other factors affecting ozone concentrations. They also developed an offline version of their stratospheric chemistry module to calculate the steady-state response of ozone to temperature and overhead ozone perturbations.
