Abstract 
This study introduces a novel heteroleptic indium complex, which incorporates an amidinate ligand, serving as a high-temperature atomic layer deposition (ALD) precursor. The most stable structure was determined using density functional theory and synthesized, demonstrating thermal stability up to 375 °C. We fabricated indium oxide thin-film transistors (In2O3TFTs) prepared with DBADMI precursor using ALD in wide range of window processing temperature of 200 °C, 300 °C, and 350 °C with an ozone (O3) as the source. The growth per cycle of ALD ranged from 0.06 to 0.1 nm cycle-1at different deposition temperatures. X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy were employed to analyze the crystalline structure as it relates to the deposition temperature. At a relatively low deposition temperature of 200 °C, an amorphous morphology was observed, while at 300 °C and 350 °C, crystalline structures were evident. Additionally, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis was conducted to identify the In-O and OH-related products in the film. The OH-related product was found to be as low as 1% with an increase the deposition temperature. Furthermore, we evaluated In2O3TFTs and observed an increase in field-effect mobility, with minimal change in the threshold voltage (Vth), at 200 °C, 300 °C, and 350 °C. Consequently, the DBADMI precursor, given its stability at highdeposition temperatures, is ideal for producing high-quality films and stable crystalline phases, with wide processing temperature range makeing it suitable for various applications.
