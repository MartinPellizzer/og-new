ABSTRACT

The state of California, USA, has developed regulations for projects that want to pursue direct potable reuse. One of the most signi
ﬁ
cant

requirements is that the treatment train must include ozone and biological activated carbon (ozone/BAC) as pretreatment to a mem-

brane-based treatment train. Ozone/BAC mitigates chemical peaks and diversi
ﬁ
es the removal mechanisms of low molecular weight

compounds likely to persist in advanced treated water. This paper will present the process bene
ﬁ
ts of ozone/BAC as pretreatment to the

membrane-based treatment train based on testing at a 3,785 m
3
 /d demonstration facility in San Diego, California, USA. One of the most sig-

ni
ﬁ
cant bene
ﬁ
ts of ozone/BAC pretreatment is the improved water quality that bene
ﬁ
ts not only the product water produced for potable

consumption but also the residual stream that is generated with the implementation of the RO process, commonly known as RO concentrate.

This improved water quality originates from TOC reduction which is achieved through a combination of chemical oxidation with ozonation

and biological growth in the BAC process that results in reduced operating pressures and chemical use for the membrane systems.

These process bene
ﬁ
ts were quanti
ﬁ
ed to develop an overall water cost comparison between a DPR and an indirect potable reuse train.

INTRODUCTION

California has large agencies, serving 20 million people, that are planning and developing large-scale potable reuse projects

that will be regulated as direct potable reuse (DPR). Signi
ﬁ
cant investments will be made in new treatment processes and

pipelines that will total more than $20 billion US. To support the development of these projects, California regulators

have been working over the past decade to develop DPR regulations. One of the most signi
ﬁ
cant requirements of the

DPR regulatory criteria is a requirement to include ozone and BAC as pretreatment to the membrane-based full advanced

treatment (FAT) train, commonly comprised of membrane
 ﬁ
ltration (MF), reverse osmosis (RO), and ultraviolet light (UV)

advanced oxidation process (AOP), that is already in operation at more than a half dozen facilities in California with

more than 8 m
3
 /s (
.
180 million gallons per day (MGD)) production capacity today. California is currently the second

state after Colorado with DPR regulations. In Colorado, ozone/BAC are optional treatment processes in contrast to Califor-

nia but Colorado also requires speci
ﬁ
c pathogen removal goals. Ozone is speci
ﬁ
cally identi
ﬁ
ed as an alternative treatment for

disinfection and ozone/BAC as an example of an alternative
 ﬁ
ltration process. Both disinfection processes, whether by ozone

or UV, and
 ﬁ
ltration are required in Colorado for DPR. Other states such as Texas have implemented a case-by-case approval

of DPR projects that rely on a blending of puri
ﬁ
ed water with other waters to achieve regulatory approvals. Other past studies
