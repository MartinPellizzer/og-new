The study's results support previous research on the use of ozone therapy as a safe and effective treatment option for infectious and purulent complications. The proposed method can be recommended for use in clinical practice without additional measures for the utilization of ozone produced by the POS-1 apparatus. Moreover, the findings suggest that the ozone-containing steam-water mixture can be used as a factor of external physical influence with pronounced bactericidal and bacteriostatic properties.
