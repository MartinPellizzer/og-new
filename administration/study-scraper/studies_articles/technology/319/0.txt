The removal of micropollutants from wastewater is a pressing concern in today's environmental landscape. Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs) have emerged as a promising solution to this problem, offering high efficiency and effectiveness. However, the traditional methods employed in AOPs, such as ozone production and light sources, are energy-intensive and expensive, making them economically unviable for large-scale implementation. To address this issue, researchers have turned to innovative technologies that utilize nanoparticles to enhance the oxidation reaction.
