In conclusion, this study demonstrates that the inclusion of an Earth-like land-ocean distribution with orography is essential for understanding the atmospheric dynamics and chemistry of tidally locked terrestrial exoplanets. The results show that such distributions can break the symmetry between the northern and southern hemispheres, leading to significant changes in atmospheric transport and chemistry. As we continue to explore the possibilities of life beyond Earth, it is crucial that we develop more sophisticated models that can accurately capture these complex processes.
