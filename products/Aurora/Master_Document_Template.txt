# System Overview

## Purpose

### Product Description

[product_name] is an automated ozone sanitization system engineered for safe and effective disinfection of enclosed environments, including but not limited to:

Typical Environments:

[environment_list]

Specialized Applications:

[application_list]

### Core Functionality

[product_name] utilizes a precisely controlled ozone generator module to produce ozone gas (Oâ‚ƒ) at calibrated output levels tailored to the volume and sanitization requirements of the target environment. 

The system ensures:

- Accurate ozone output control through closed-loop feedback from onboard ozone concentration sensors
- Automated sanitization cycles programmable via [interface_type]
- Safety mechanisms including lockouts, alarms, and ventilation delays to prevent unsafe ozone exposure

### Design Intent

[product_name] is purpose-built to:

- Deliver consistent sanitization performance with ozone outputs ranging from [ozone_output_min] to [ozone_output_max] mg/hour, ensuring pathogen neutralization without exceeding safe exposure limits
- Operate fully autonomously or under user supervision, adapting cycle times and output based on sensor data and user inputs
- >>> Provide robust safety controls to comply with [list applicable standards or regulations, e.g., "OSHA, UL, IEC 61010"]
- >>> Enable easy integration into existing environments via [mention connectivity options, e.g., "Wi-Fi/Bluetooth modules, cloud platform compatibility"]

### Key Operational Highlights

- Input Power: Designed to operate reliably from a [input_voltage_value][input_voltage_unit] [input_voltage_type] source delivering up to [input_power_max_value][input_power_max_unit]
- Environmental Conditions: Optimized for indoor environments within temperature range [operating_temperature_min]-[operating_temperature_max] [operating_temperature_unit] and humidity levels [operating_humidity_min]-[operating_humidity_max][operating_humidity_unit]
- Cycle Management: Supports user-programmable sanitization cycles from [operating_time_min] to [operating_time_max] [operating_time_unit] with automatic ventilation and cooldown phases
- User Interface: [interface_type]
- >>> Safety Features: Includes [list safety features unique to Aurora, e.g., "high-voltage isolation, ozone concentration auto-shutdown, residual ozone decay timer, audible/visual alerts"]

### Summary

Aurora is engineered to provide a safe, reliable, and easy-to-use ozone sanitization solution tailored specifically for [application_main]. Through its integrated sensor feedback and safety-first design, Aurora ensures effective pathogen neutralization while maintaining strict compliance with ozone exposure limits.
