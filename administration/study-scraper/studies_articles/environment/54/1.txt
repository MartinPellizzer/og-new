The study employed a combination of laboratory experiments and field trials to investigate the effects of ozone gas on fresh horticultural produce. Fresh fruits and vegetables were treated with varying concentrations of ozone gas for different durations, and then analyzed for changes in quality parameters such as texture, color, and microbial load. The results were compared with those obtained from traditional methods of preservation.
