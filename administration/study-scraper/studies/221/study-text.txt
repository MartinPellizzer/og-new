HJD has significantly increased. Furthermore, the HJD performance can be improved by SIE with UVO and postannealing, especially for the reverse breakdown characteristics. Finally, a high-performance HJD without any terminal structure is obtained, which exhibits a low specific on-resistance of 2.47 m
