The analysis reveals that the Outer Space Treaty and the Montreal Protocol fall short in addressing the issue of orbital spacecraft emissions and ozone depletion. Article IX of the Outer Space Treaty lacks a comprehensive solution to address emissions from orbital spacecraft, while the Montreal Protocol's regulatory jurisdiction does not cover the threat posed by orbital spacecraft emissions. The results highlight the need for a new international agreement to address this regulatory vacuum.
