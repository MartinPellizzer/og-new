In conclusion, this study demonstrates the significant impact of Australian bushfires on polar stratospheric clouds. The results highlight the importance of considering bushfire aerosols in models of stratospheric chemistry and PSC dynamics. These findings have important implications for our understanding of global climate change and ozone depletion. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms underlying these interactions, but this study provides a crucial step forward in advancing our knowledge of extreme wildfire events and their impact on the stratosphere.
