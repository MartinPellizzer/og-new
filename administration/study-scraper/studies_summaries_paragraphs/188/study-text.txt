Here is a summary of the study in 1 detailed paragraph, focusing on ozone-related information:

Fusarium infection in wheat can lead to scab, mycotoxin contamination, and yield reduction. In this study, three Fusarium strains (N1, N2, and N3) were isolated and identified, with N1 and N3 producing zearalenone and vomitoxin, but not fumonisin, while N2 did not produce these toxins. To assess the effect of gas fumigation on the strains, ozone and chlorine dioxide were used, with results showing that chlorine dioxide effectively inhibited mycelium growth and spore germination, whereas ozone only inhibited spore germination without affecting mycelium growth. This study highlights the potential application of chlorine dioxide in controlling Fusarium infections, while ozone's effectiveness is limited to inhibiting spore germination.
