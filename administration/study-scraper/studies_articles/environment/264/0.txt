Urban air quality improvement is a significant challenge in China, with ozone (O3) pollution being a major concern. The formation of surface O3 is intricately linked to chemical reactions that are influenced by both meteorological conditions and local emissions of precursors. Despite a series of emission reduction measures implemented in urban areas, the effectiveness of O3 pollution control has proven inadequate. This study aimed to investigate the impact of decoupling meteorological factors on ozone pollution control in urban areas using machine learning methods.
