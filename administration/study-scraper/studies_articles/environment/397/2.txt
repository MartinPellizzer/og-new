The results showed significant increases in O3-8h concentrations during the period considered, with notable seasonal variations. The ozone and temperature change response slope (KO3-T) indicated that local emissions had no significant effect on O3-8h generation. Average O3-8h concentration and maximum temperature (Tmax) values exhibited a polynomial distribution. Specifically, at Tmax < 27°C, O3-8h concentrations increased almost linearly with increasing temperature; at Tmax between 27 and 37°C, the trend showed an upward curvilinear pattern; and at Tmax > 37°C, O3-8h concentrations decreased with increasing temperature.
