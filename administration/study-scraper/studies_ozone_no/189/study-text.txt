Abstract
Tropopause-overshooting convection in the midlatitudes provides a rapid transport pathway for air from the lower troposphere to reach the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) and can result in the formation of above-anvil cirrus plumes (AACPs) that significantly hydrate the stratosphere. Such UTLS composition changes alter the radiation budget and impact climate. Novel in situ observations from the NASA Dynamics and Chemistry of the Summer Stratosphere (DCOTSS) field campaign are used in this study to examine UTLS impacts from AACP-generating overshooting convection. Namely, a research flight on 31 May 2022 sampled active convection over the state of Oklahoma for more than 3 h with the NASA ER-2 high-altitude research aircraft. An AACP was bisected during this flight, providing the first such extensive in situ sampling of this phenomenon. The convective observations reveal pronounced changes in air mass composition and stratospheric hydration up to altitudes of 2.3 km above the tropopause and concentrations more than double background levels. Unique dynamic and trace gas signatures were found within the AACP, including enhanced vertical mixing near the AACP edge and a positive correlation between water vapor and ozone. Moreover, the water vapor enhancement within the AACP was found to be limited to the saturation mixing ratio of the low temperature overshoot and AACP air. Comparison with all remaining DCOTSS flights demonstrates that the 31 May 2022 flight had some of the largest tropospheric tracer and water vapor perturbations in the stratosphere and within the AACP.

1 Introduction
The tropopause is often viewed as a sharp boundary separating the troposphere and stratosphere. However, dynamic processes routinely impact the tropopause region and modify the characteristics of a variably deep layer that is commonly referred to as the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS). The most rapid of these processes, tropopause-overshooting convection (hereafter “overshooting convection”), facilitates transport of air from the lower troposphere to the UTLS in minutes to hours and can enable irreversible mixing between these layers, known as stratosphere–troposphere exchange (STE). Transport and corresponding STE from overshooting convection alters the composition of the UTLS, modifying greenhouse gases such as water vapor and ozone (Holton et al., 1995; Stohl et al., 2003). This can impact the radiation budget and climate, as the radiation budget is especially sensitive to composition changes within the UTLS. For example, the radiative forcing by water vapor in the UTLS is most sensitive to changes in the extratropical lowermost stratosphere (Solomon et al., 2010; Banerjee et al., 2019), while that for ozone is most sensitive to changes in the upper troposphere (Lacis et al., 1990). Overshooting convection is also commonly associated with severe weather, as these storm produce hazards including hail, tornadoes, and strong winds (Fujita, 1974; Brunner et al., 2007; Bedka, 2011; Dworak et al., 2012; Bedka et al., 2015, 2018; Marion et al., 2019; Sandmæl et al., 2019). To date, much of what we know about the impacts of overshooting convection on the UTLS is based on remotely sensed observations and numerical modeling studies. Few airborne field campaigns have extensively sampled (more than a few minutes) tropopause-overshooting convection, resulting in limited in situ observations of these storms (Smith et al., 2017; Homeyer et al., 2014b).
Tropopause-overshooting convection occurs worldwide and is most frequent over land in the midlatitudes, especially in North and South America (Liu and Liu, 2016; Liu et al., 2020; Clapp et al., 2023; Nugent and Bretherton, 2023). The United States, specifically the Great Plains region, has been recognized as a unique hotspot of deep and frequent overshooting based on satellite and radar observations (Solomon et al., 2016; Cooney et al., 2018; Homeyer and Bowman, 2021). Overshooting convection in the United States is most frequent in the warm season (March–August), with notable annual and diurnal cycles. Approximately half of overshooting convection in the United States reaches the stratospheric overworld (potential temperature (θ)> 380 K; Cooney et al., 2018), where the impacts from these events on the stratosphere can last weeks to months as this air will take longer to descend back to the troposphere in the midlatitudes (Holton et al., 1995). Additionally, air that reaches the stratospheric overworld can be isentropically transported toward the tropics where it may enter the upward branch of the Brewer–Dobson circulation, further extending its stratospheric lifetime (Chang et al., 2023). Despite not being studied explicitly, overshooting convection frequency will likely increase in the future as favorable environments for severe thunderstorms are projected to increase with a warming climate (Del Genio et al., 2007; Trapp et al., 2007; Lepore et al., 2021).
A key storm feature commonly associated with midlatitude tropopause-overshooting convection is the above-anvil cirrus plume (AACP). AACPs are cirrus clouds that reside above the anvil within the stratosphere and are commonly identified in visible and infrared (IR) satellite imagery (Wang, 2003; Luderer et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2016; Homeyer et al., 2017). When AACPs appear warm relative to the underlying anvil cloud in IR imagery, this indicates stratospheric injection of cloud ice and subsequent hydration via sublimation (Murillo and Homeyer, 2022). These plumes are known to be driven by gravity wave breaking near and within the overshooting top in environments with strong storm-relative winds (the difference between the environmental wind and storm motion) in the UTLS, which is associated with the establishment of a hydraulic jump (Wang, 2003; Luderer et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2016; Homeyer et al., 2017; O'Neill et al., 2021). This hydraulic jump occurs near the tropopause and downstream of the overshooting top, where the overshooting top acts as a topographic obstacle. While our appreciation for the impact that various storm and environmental characteristics (including whether an AACP is produced) have on the amount of overshooting and cross-tropopause transport is increasing, most prior observational work does not consider such characteristics when evaluating the UTLS impacts associated with these storms.
UTLS composition impacts from overshooting convection have been explored broadly via satellite observations (Randel et al., 2012; Schwartz et al., 2013; Smith et al., 2017; Werner et al., 2020; Tinney and Homeyer, 2021) and specifically using observations from airborne field campaigns (Poulida et al., 1996; Fischer et al., 2003; Fromm and Servranckx, 2003; Hegglin et al., 2004; Frey et al., 2015; Hanisco et al., 2007; Homeyer et al., 2011; Anderson et al., 2012; Homeyer et al., 2014b; Pan et al., 2014; Herman et al., 2017; Smith et al., 2017; Khaykin et al., 2022). These studies have shown that water vapor in the UTLS is enhanced through both sublimation of ice and air mass transport and that water vapor and additional tropospheric and stratospheric trace gases have been observed to be modified up to 4 km above the tropopause. The contribution to the global lower stratosphere H2O budget from overshooting convection is currently estimated to range from 10 %–15 %, based on several studies using output from convection-resolving model simulations and observations of storms with a trajectory model driven by large-scale winds (Dauhut and Hohenegger, 2022; Dessler and Sherwood, 2004; Tinney and Homeyer, 2021; Ueyama et al., 2023). This is likely an underestimation, as most existing efforts to quantify the lower stratosphere H2O budget only consider effects from tropical convection. However, there has been increasing attention towards midlatitude convection contributions to the lower stratosphere H2O budget, due to its observed frequency and depth (Khaykin et al., 2009; Liu and Liu, 2016; Liu et al., 2020; Werner et al., 2020).
Stratospheric hydration from convection has been encountered in a few prior field campaigns, including the SCOUT-AMMA aircraft campaign over Africa (Khaykin et al., 2009); the Aura Validation Experiment (AVE) aircraft campaign over the United States (Hanisco et al., 2007; Anderson et al., 2012; Smith et al., 2017); the Studies of Emissions, Atmospheric Composition, Clouds and Climate Coupling by Regional Surveys (SEAC4RS) aircraft campaign over the United States (Smith et al., 2017); and the Deep Convective Clouds and Chemistry (DC3) field campaign over the United States (Homeyer et al., 2014b; Pan et al., 2014). The majority of convective encounters within these field campaigns was serendipitous rather than targeted. The SEAC4RS campaign targeted convective outflow from an AACP-producing storm that occurred ∼ 20 h prior to flight, detailed in Smith et al. (2017). In situ data were used to estimate that between 6.6 and 13.5 kt of water vapor was irreversibly delivered to the lower stratosphere from this convective system. Most airborne observations of overshooting convection and UTLS impacts are associated with recent (less than 36 h between overshooting and sampling) or aged convection (longer than 36 h between overshooting and convection) rather than active convection (measurements in or near an active convective complex with co-located cloud observations, which can range from minutes to a few hours old), especially within the lower stratosphere. The DC3 field campaign had active convection targeting, which occurred primarily in the upper troposphere. The G5 and DC-8 aircraft used during DC3, however, did encounter convectively injected H2O at altitudes up to 1–2 km above the tropopause near active overshooting convection during a flight on 20 May 2012, detailed in Homeyer et al. (2014b). Water vapor enhancements exceeded 200 ppmv above background concentrations in the lower stratosphere, with evidence of extensive mixing between troposphere and stratosphere air within this broad H2O enhancement. Additionally, an AACP was briefly encountered within this flight, measured at a distant range from the parent overshoot for approximately 30 s.
As past observations of overshoot-influenced air are limited, much of the current understanding of the impact of overshooting convection on the UTLS has been gleaned from numerical model simulations. Simulations of overshooting convection suggest the amount of overshooting and cross-tropopause transport is sensitive to storm mode (Mesoscale Convective System or MCS versus a discrete supercell) and the characteristics of the lower stratospheric environment, such as stability and the strength of storm-relative winds (Mullendore et al., 2005; Bigelbach et al., 2014; Homeyer et al., 2014a; Starzec et al., 2020; O'Neill et al., 2021; Gordon and Homeyer, 2022). The amount of STE from overshooting convection also appears to depend on the height of the tropopause and, more generally, UTLS temperature (Phoenix and Homeyer, 2021). A lower UTLS temperature is an important constraint for stratospheric hydration, while a higher tropopause also impacts air mass transport as it is harder to reach since it allows for greater cumulative diluting effects on air within the convective updraft that result from entrainment of environmental (free troposphere) air. Within these known sensitivities, multiple simulations have shown that water vapor enhancements have appeared to reach higher altitudes than passive tropospheric tracers (Homeyer, 2015; Phoenix and Homeyer, 2021; Gordon and Homeyer, 2022). Furthermore, recent numerical modeling studies have identified the unique influence of AACP-producing storms on UTLS composition (O'Neill et al., 2021; Gordon and Homeyer, 2022). Specifically, troposphere-to-stratosphere (TST) transport is greater in AACP-producing storms. Additionally, AACP-producing storms feature enhanced downward transport of overworld air to the lowermost stratosphere (the portion below 380 K potential temperature) compared to non-AACP storms (Gordon and Homeyer, 2022). Many of these modeling results have yet to be verified
