Air pollution is a severe problem affecting both the environment and public health. The assessment of air pollution risk using evaluation tools that examine its effects on health helps identify areas and times of impact on public health, as well as strategies to prevent risks and reduce negative health effects. This study aims to investigate the relationships between factors affecting air pollution risk using fuzzy decision-making and experimental evaluation (DEMATEL) methods.
