The monitoring of stratospheric ozone and temperature over Germany since the 1960s is crucial for understanding long-term changes in the upper atmosphere. Ground-based measurements of total ozone column (TOC) and ozone profile soundings have been conducted at various stations in Germany, providing valuable insights into the effects of ozone-depleting substances (ODS) on stratospheric ozone and temperature. This study presents a comprehensive analysis of the data collected over the past five decades.
