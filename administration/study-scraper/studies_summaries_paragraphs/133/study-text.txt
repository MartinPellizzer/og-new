Here is a summarized paragraph focusing on ozone-related information and data:

Global soil nitrous acid (HONO) emissions have increased by 2.3% from 1980 to 2016, driven by climate change and fertilization changes, which aggravate global ozone pollution. The study finds that rising fertilizer use has intensified soil emissions in major grain-producing regions such as India, China, and North America, while climate change has primarily increased emissions in Africa and South America. Incorporating soil HONO emissions into a global chemistry-climate model improves its performance and simulates a 2.9% increase (up to 29%) in global surface ozone concentrations, posing a risk of vegetation exposure to ozone, particularly in crop-production regions.
