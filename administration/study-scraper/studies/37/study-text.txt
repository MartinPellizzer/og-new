NTRODUCTION

Semiconductors and optoelectronics are the main production technologies in high
-
tech industries. The

convenience brought by these industries also causes great environmental pollution. The main reason is that

organic solvents are used in t
he production process, and the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) derived from

them cause serious damage to the environment.

The
 current
 methods
 for
 treating
 VOCs
 mainly
 include
 condensation,
 absorption,
 adsorption,

combustion, biodegradation, and advanced
 oxidation processes (AOP), etc. The condensation method has limits

on the concentration of VOCs; the absorption method requires the use of solvents, which will increase pollution
.

T
he adsorption method often uses activated carbon as the adsorbent, but acti
vated carbon that loses its effect after

use will cause increased costs and secondary pollution to the environment
.
 Th
e
 combustion
 method
 can degrade

organic matter, but burning produces carbon dioxide, which will make the greenhouse effect more severe
. T
he

biodegradation method often leads to the death of bacteria in many organic substances and requires a lot of time to

cultivate, so it is not cost
-
effective in industry
. T
he advanced oxidation method is widely used in wastewater

treatment,
 the
 high oxidat
ion activity can effectively destroy and decompose organic matter.

ichlorobenzene is the main raw material for
 the production of
 herbicides
 which will
remain in
 soil

or sediment. The dichlorobenzene in the soil is
 hard
 to be decomposed by organic matte
r in the soil,
 in turn, it will

be
 then absorbed by plants or fish. Inhaling or ingesting
 related
 dichlorobenzene
 compounds
 can cause damage to

the liver and can also affect the kidneys and blood.

Ozone is strong oxidant and plays an important role in reac
tion of atmospheric chemistry.
During past

twenty years, the research of reaction of ozone has attracted interest
[
1
]
.
There have been many studies on the

reaction of benzene and dimethylbenzene with ozone
 [2-5]
. Methyl group is an electron-donating group which is

conducive to the electrophilic reaction of ozone while chlorine is an electron withdrawing group.
 Therefore,

this study will explore the reaction between benzene ring containing electron withdrawing groups, such

as1,2-dichlorobenzene,with
 ozone.
 The
 analysis
 of
 the
 products
 generated
 after
 the
 reaction
 between

1,2-dichlorobenzene and ozone will help to understand the possible reaction mechanism.

 RESULTS

Analysis
 of IR spectra

Ozone was directly passed through the
 1,2
-
dichlorobenzene
 liquid and
 the color of the reaction solution

was changed with time, as shown in
 Figure
 3
.
When the reaction
 time exceeds
 over 13 hours, oil droplets
 were

observed
.
 The reaction solution
 stand for
 4 to 5 days, brown precipitate
 was appeared
.
Infrared spectra of
 1,2

dichlorobenzene
 after ozone passing through at various time were summarized as Figure 4.
The peak shape
was

observed
a slightly change

 may
 contain C=O and

OH functional group.

The intensity of these two peaks were increased with reaction time, indicating the amount of product was

increased
.
