The results showed that during the warm season, transport and dispersion had a significant impact on O3 concentration, with positive contributions ranging from 12.9% to 24.0%. After normalizing for meteorological conditions, the sensitivity of O3 formation changed from the NOx-limited regime to a transition regime between VOC- and NOx-limited regimes during pollution events. Vehicle exhaust was found to be the primary source of VOC emissions, contributing 41.8% to VOCs during pollution periods.
