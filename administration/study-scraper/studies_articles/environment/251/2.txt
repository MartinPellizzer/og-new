The results show a striking North-South asymmetry in the simulated O3 distribution on TRAPPIST-1e. The concentration of O3 is highest near the South pole, below an altitude of 10 hPa (approximately 30 km). This asymmetry is attributed to the presence of landmasses on the night side, which cause drag in near-surface flows and lead to an asymmetric meridional overturning circulation. The total ozone column density was found to be significantly higher than on Earth, with values of up to 8000 Dobson Units (DU) near the South pole.
