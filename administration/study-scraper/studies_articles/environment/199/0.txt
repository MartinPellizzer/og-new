London is known for its congested roads and dense population, which can have devastating effects on air quality. The relationship between nitrogen oxides (NOx) and ground-level ozone (O3) in London has been a subject of concern for environmental scientists. A recent study analyzed the interrelations among ambient air pollutants - NO, NO2, and O3 - across four air quality monitoring stations representing different areas of London. This comprehensive analysis aimed to investigate the complex relationship between NOx and O3 and provide insights into their behavior over time.
