Abstract:
Megacities exert substantial demands on the world's energy resources, thereby producing large shares of atmospheric emissions and air pollution. Despite several studies on nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) changes in megacities, a systematic analysis in relation to settlement growth is still pending. This study examines the trends of tropospheric NO 2 pollution in 38 megacities regarding settlement growth by analyzing Earth Observation data. Multiannual records of tropospheric NO 2 from Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME), Scanning Imaging Absorption Spectrometer for Atmospheric Chartography, GOME-2A, and GOME-2B are evaluated regarding the World Settlement Footprint evolution from 1996 to 2015. Compared to previous studies, this work strictly uses remote sensing data and the spatial concept of functional urban areas. Therefore, uncertainties due to inconsistent spatial references, incomparable administrative units, as well as heterogeneously reported local data are widely excluded to enable an appropriate comparison of megacities across the globe. On average, we observe an increase in tropospheric NO 2 burden of 5.06 ± 0.83%/year and a relative settlement growth of 2.87%/year for the time period considered. We find a wide range of trends: relative NO 2 pollution ranges from an increase of 44.0 ± 5.9%/year to a decrease of −3.2 ± 0.2%/year, settlement growth rates vary from 0.3%/year to 9.5%/year. Despite this variety, the results exhibit a pronounced relation to the income group following the world's economies classification of the World Bank. Complemented by a cluster analysis and ranking of the megacities, the study provides indicators to develop a better understanding of the drivers and impacts of urbanization and air pollution.

SECTION I.
Introduction
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), air pollution is now considered the largest single environmental health risk [1]. Humans are exposed daily to a variety of environmental stressors, such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), and particulate matter (PM), to name a few. These can lead to a wide spectrum of adverse health effects ranging from cardiovascular, respiratory, and metabolic diseases to susceptibility to infectious diseases, such as influenza or COVID-19 [2], [3], [4], [5]. A recent study showed that an average of 2.9 years of life expectancy is lost worldwide due to (outdoor) air pollution [6]. Around 99% of the global population is exposed to air pollutant levels that exceed the WHO guideline limits, with low- and middle-income countries suffering from the highest exposures [1].
Although air pollution is a challenge of global importance, exposure to air pollutants is predominantly an urban threat [2]. Urban areas across the globe account for less than 2% of the land surface only; however, they have always been spatial focal points of air pollution and resource needs as they consume two-thirds of the global energy with a majority of fossil fuels [7].
The rise in the world's urban population over the past few decades has led to an increase in the number of megacities, generally defined as cities with a population of greater than 10 million [8]. As such, megacities have become global centers of population growth, settlement growth, production, energy demand, and as a consequence emission of greenhouse gases, air pollutants, and their precursor substances [9]. As these cities continue to grow [10], emissions are a concern, not only for local air quality but also for regional and continental scales and even for global climate, due to interactions with processes linked to climate change, such as radiative forcing [11], [12]. Evaluating past air pollutant trends in urban areas gives insight into the effectiveness of previous and current policies to curb emissions and control these levels, and possibly supports measures for future policies [13].
This study focuses on the air pollutant NO2 as it can be attributed mainly to anthropogenic combustion processes associated with transport, industry, energy production, and heating [9]. Due to its short lifetime in the lowermost troposphere during daytime (2–8 h), it predominantly remains at the emission sources and its amount is sensitive to emission changes [14], [15]. NO2 is a regulated air pollutant and directives demand routine monitoring by ground-based stations in ambient air. However, the global availability of these measurements is heterogenous, the spatial representativity of point measurements for large urban landscapes is limited, and such data is often scarce in the Global South. Since 1995, space-based observation of the tropospheric composition has enabled operational daily monitoring of NO2 levels on a global scale [16]. Contrary to in-situ measurements, space-based observations are gathered homogeneously with the same instrument and are sampled on a consistent and spatially integrating grid [17]. However, these differ from in-situ measurements at ground level as they yield indirect measurements of vertically integrated quantities, such as tropospheric NO2 column densities [18], [19].
Due to the short lifetime of NO2 and its predominantly human origin from combustion processes, as outlined above, tropospheric NO2 constitutes an invaluable tracer to examine the anthropogenic footprint in the troposphere as well as human activity in different geographic perspectives and scales [17], [20], [21], [22]. Since natural contributions to the tropospheric NO2 burden are small and are confined to lightning [23] and microbial processes in soils [24], it has been used to delineate urban pollution islands and pollution hotspots [20], [22], [25] and to reveal weekly cycles reflecting anthropogenic activity patterns in urban environments [21], [26], [27]. Furthermore, tropospheric NO2 column densities have been extensively used to infer NOx emissions, see, e.g., [15], [28], [29], and [30].
Several satellite-based studies analyzed NO2 changes and trends in selected regions or megacities by examining multiannual records from a single sensor or a multisensor approach. In the first study, Richter et al. [31] performed a linear regression of tropospheric NO2 annual means from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME) [16] for several regions in the world. A detailed analysis on NO2 trends over China combining data from GOME and the SCanning Imaging Absorption spectroMeter for Atmospheric ChartographY (SCIAMACHY) [32] was published by van der A et al. [33]. They used the time series analysis approach of Weatherhead et al. [34] in a simplified way to detect trends in monthly mean data and to examine their significance. For a selection of megacities and urban agglomerations, NO2 trends were derived from single-sensor data records using the same time series analysis method by Schneider and van der A [35] and Schneider et al. [36], while Konovalov et al. [37] applied a nonlinear trend fitting and Geddes et al. [38] used least-squares linear regression. Finally, the combination of data records from different sensors enabled the generation of longer times series and the detection of robust trends [39] and even trend reversals [40].
However, the derived trends in all these studies have so far neither been related to consistent spatial units like functional [41] or morphological urban areas [42], nor sufficiently to socioeconomic status or demographic parameters. This limits the interpretation of the findings and the reliability of a global comparison of cities. In previous studies, the derived trends are often related to a city or megacity, but no transparent spatial delineation is defined [39], [40]. Whether the observed mean or trend refers solely to the city center or to a grid cell covering the urban area and its surroundings becomes increasingly important as cities grow in size. It is inevitable to define a spatial unit for geographic comparisons, in particular, for such large agglomerations, such as megacities or megaregions [17], [43]. In addition, interpreting trends alone might result in ambiguous conclusions. On the one hand, a decreasing trend in NO2 could result from a decline in population or traffic, reduced production or wealth. On the other hand, it could result from a transition to a green economy or energy and the implementation of new measures mitigating emissions like the introduction of new filtering techniques or electromobility, to name a few. Beyond that, population numbers or the gross domestic product (GDP) generally refer to administrative units leading to inconsistent spatial delineations of cities introducing bias in comparisons across cities [42]. In addition, they strongly vary in quality depending on the country and result in heterogenous datasets for comparisons of cities across the globe. As such, these numbers, concepts, and findings are prone to large uncertainties.
Therefore, a global objective and consistent measure from Earth Observation (EO) data are required. The World Settlement Footprint (WSF) [44] is derived from satellite data and exhibits an objective and multitemporal estimate of settlement growth that is considered a proxy for urbanization and economic development in this work. EO has proven to be an effective instrument, in particular, with respect to large-scale mapping of human settlements, such as megacities at continental and global scales [10], [45]. The WSF evolution [46] that is available yearly from 1985 to 2015 provides an essential component to develop a better understanding of the drivers and impacts of urbanization and air pollution [47]. A first attempt to link the settlement footprint to NO2 trends was made by Erbertseder et al. [48].
Against this background, this study centers on a systematic analysis of 38 megacities across the globe in relation to NO2 pollution trends and settlement growth from 1996 to 2015. The study purely relies on satellite-based EO data. To overcome the problem of missing and heterogeneously defined spatial units, these data are rigorously analyzed with respect to functional urban areas (FUA) that provide a delineation of the cities based on principles of urban economics [41]. Furthermore, the results are ranked, classified, and interpreted regarding the income groups according to the world's economies classification of the World Bank [49]. The study aims at drawing overarching conclusions concerning the full spectrum of megacities, encompassing aspects, such as anthropogenic pollution and settlement growth, serving as a proxy for both urbanization and economic development. In addition, it will facilitate an analysis of their transformative stages, including transitions toward environmental sustainability (green transition), and their position within the global economic landscape.
The rest of this article is organized as follows. Section II describes the study area and the datasets used, followed by Section III outlining the methodology. Sections IV and V present the results and discussion including strengths, limitations, and perspectives of the work. Finally, Section VI concludes this article.
SECTION II.
Study Area and Data
A. Functional Urban Areas
Instead of conventional, but heterogeneously defined administrative city units or arbitrarily chosen grid cells or geographic domains, we apply the concept of FUAs. This approach enables us to consistently delineate megacity areas and megaregions against their rural surroundings and to define their spatial extent and urban pollution island. An FUA is defined by aspects of urban economics and consists of a city and its commuting zone, where the latter represents the area of influence of the city in terms of labor market flows. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development defines an FUA as the union of the administrative units in which at least 15% of the population is commuting to the main urban center of the area. To improve international comparability of urban-related statistics and indicators with an explicit spatial dimension, this method was developed further to estimate the number and extent of FUAs worldwide based on objective characteristics [41]. The improved method does neither rely on information on local unit boundaries nor data on commuting flows, which are usually unavailable in most countries. The FUAs are estimated through an automated classification procedure based on uniformly measurable parameters, such as travel time from urban centers, area of urban centers, local population, and country GDP per capita. These classification results are available as the Global Human Settlement Functional Urban Area (GHS-FUA) layer. To be consistent with the other datasets in this study, we apply the GHS_FUA_UCDB2015_GLOBE_R2019A dataset for the reference year 20151 [50]. These FUAs, defined as polygon for each megacity, are used consistently throughout the study for any spatial aggregation.
B. Megacities
Megacities are defined by the United Nations (UN) as a conurbation or metropolitan area with a population exceeding 10 million inhabitants [8]. This study comprises 38 megacities across the globe referring to the baseline year 2015 (see Table I). By means of the World Urbanization Prospects, the Population Division of the UN provides time series of the population of the largest 30 cities or cities with over 300k inhabitants and their population [8]. However, as can be inferred from Table I, the megacities examined in this study primarily follow the ranking of the largest cities with respect to the population of the FUAs. A previous study has substantiated that a global ranking of the largest cities is a challenging task [42]. This is evident by the differing population numbers given by the UN and GHS-FUA depending on the administrative areas under consideration. The list of megacities in this article includes the 30 cities with the largest population in 2015 regarding the FUAs of the Global Human Settlement Layer [50] and the 30 largest cities in the world as of 2015 according to the UN [8]. As such, the list can be considered as a representative selection of megacities and a valid combination of these two datasets. However, only the population numbers of the FUAs are considered in any further analysis here.

C. NO2 Pollution
Global observations of the tropospheric NO2 burden are derived from GOME (1996–2003) [16], SCIAMACHY (2002–2012) [32], and GOME-2A and GOME-2B (2007–2015; 2013–2015) [51]. These instruments are nadir-scanning spectrometers that orbit in a polar Sun-synchronous pattern with a fixed equator crossing time. The spectrometers are passive and sense backscattered solar radiation from the Earth's atmosphere and surface as well as extraterrestrial solar irradiance ranging from the ultraviolet to the visible and near-infrared portion of the spectrum at a high spectral resolution of less than 0.5 nm. The retrieval algorithm for NO2 is based on the Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS) technique exploiting the wavelength range from 405 to 465 nm. This method is utilized to derive the total slant column of NO2 from the radiance spectra measured by the instrument. By applying the Beer–Lambert law, the DOAS fitting procedure entails a least-squares inversion aimed at isolating absorption signatures attributable to trace gases from the influence of broadband background processes, such as extinction arising from scattering on molecules and aerosols. In the next step, the total slant column density of NO2 is converted into a vertical column density. After separating the stratospheric NO2 contribution from the total vertical column, the resulting tropospheric residue can finally be converted into the tropospheric NO2 vertical column density by applying the ratio of stratospheric and tropospheric air mass factors. The NO2 content is finally given as the number of molecules per area (molecules /cm2), mol per area (mol/m2), or area-related mass (μg/m2).
To combine the tropospheric NO2 observations given the different sensor and orbit characteristics, a methodology was developed in [39]. The approach was applied Georgoulias et al. [40] to gain a self-consistent dataset of monthly mean values on a regular grid of 0.25° × 0.25° spatial resolution. This study is based on the dataset of [40] as provided by www.temis.nl. To be consistent with the other data sources of the study, the time period considered covers 1996–2015.
D. Settlement Footprint
To track the rapid urbanization observed in the recent past, yearly high-resolution settlement footprint data are a prerequisite for any further analysis. The settlement growth of the megacities under consideration is, therefore, derived from the WSF [44]. It comprises a binary mask outlining the extent of human settlements worldwide. In particular, the WSF evolution dataset is used to outline the global human settlement extent at a 30 m spatial resolution on a yearly basis from 1985 to 2015 [46].
The classification was performed on the Google Earth Engine platform using the complete record of Landsat imagery. For each year, all available Landsat-5 and −7 scenes that were acquired over a given area of interest were gathered. After performing cloud and cloud-shadow masking, spectral indices were derived. Among others, these include the normalized difference built-up index, normalized difference vegetation index, and modified normalized difference water index. In the next step, key statistics were calculated, including temporal mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum. Temporal features prove generally robust if computed over at least seven clear cloud-/cloud-shadow-free observations. Accordingly, if this constraint was not satisfied for a given pixel in the target year, the time frame was enlarged backward until the condition was met. The WSF data are available via the DLR EOC Geoservice.2
E. Income Group
The World Bank Group assigns the world's economies to four income groups—low, lower-middle, upper-middle, and high [49], [52]. The classifications are updated each year on 1 July, based on the gross national income (GNI) per capita of the previous calendar year. GNI measures are expressed in U.S. dollars using conversion factors derived according to the Atlas method, which in its current form was introduced in 1989. The World Bank's income classification aims to reflect a country's level of development, drawing on Atlas GNI per capita as a broadly available indicator of economic capacity.

Methodology
A. Conceptualization
The study aims at analyzing, ranking, and classifying megacities with respect to NO2 air pollution and settlement growth and to examine their statistical relationship. The conceptualization and methodology are illustrated in Fig. 1 and can be summarized as follows.

Conceptualization of the methodology.
Show All
The first step to achieve these objectives is the exploitation of globally consistent satellite-based long-term records of tropospheric NO2 (see Section II-C) and the settlement footprint (see Section II-D) from 1996 to 2015.
Second, the FUAs (see Section II-A) for the 38 megacities (see Section II-B) and the epoch of 2015 were derived from the GHSL_FUA and represented by polygons in shapefiles. Consistently, additional urban parameters, such as population or area size of the FUAs, were extracted.
Third, the time series of tropospheric NO2 was extracted for each megacity's FUA. Therefore, all the monthly means were oversampled on a 0.01 × 0.01° grid without any interpolation. For each megacity and month, an FUA-weighted statistic was calculated, including mean, minimum, maximum, standard deviation, number of pixels, and number of missing values as a consequence of cloud cover in the corresponding month.
Fourth, the settlement footprint, i.e., WSF evolution data, was extracted for each megacity within the corresponding FUA and time period on a yearly basis (see Section III-C).
Fifth, the analysis of the resulting time series and the separation of the linear trend component were performed by time series decomposition, as described in Section III-B. The absolute and relative settlement growth rates were derived based on the statistical moments of the settlement area increments.
Sixth, the megacities were systematically analyzed and ranked according to the relative tropospheric NO2 trends (%/year) and the relative settlement growth (%/year). The megacities were further examined regarding the per capita pollution and the income group following the world's economies classification of the World Bank (see Section II-E).
Seventh, by means of regression analysis, the hypothesis was tested whether there is a statistical relationship between relative NO2 trends and relative settlement growth in megacities (both in %/year).
Finally, the spectrum of megacities was analyzed by k-means clustering to yield a classification of the megacities with respect to NO2 air pollution and settlement growth (see Section III-D). Can we identify groups of megacities that evolve similarly? Which megacities exhibit strong settlement growth while reducing the overall NO2 burden by implementing measures of green transition?
The method proposed in this study will enable us to derive general conclusions for the entire range of megacities, regarding urbanization and settlement growth, their transformative stages toward environmental sustainability, and their positioning in the world economies.
B. Time Series Analysis of NO2 Data
Based on the satellite long-term records of tropospheric NO2 (see Section II-C), a time series analysis with a multicomponent model [34] was applied to identify linear trends of NO2 and their uncertainties in megacities. This approach has been widely used to model geophysical quantities and, in particular, monthly means of observed tropospheric NO2 vertical column densities Y as a function of time t [33], [39], [40], [53] \begin{equation*} Yt\; = \;\;\mu + {S_t} + \frac{1}{{12}}\omega + {N_t} \tag{1} \end{equation*}
View Source
where μ is a constant term, St is the seasonal component, ω represents the linear trend per year, and Nt is the residual variability. The seasonal component is modeled as a sinusoidal and is assumed to be stationary, i.e., invariant in time \begin{equation*} {\mathrm{S}_t} = \mathop \sum \limits_{J = 1{\rm{\;}}}^4 \left[ {{\beta _{1,j}}\sin \left( {\frac{{2{\rm{\pi }}jt}}{{12}}} \right) + {\beta _{2,j}}\cos \left( {\frac{{2\pi jt}}{{12}}} \right)} \right]{\rm{\;}}\; \tag{2} \end{equation*}
View Source
where eight superimposed harmonics are fitted by the coefficients β1,1–β2,4. For the unexplained part of the time series, the noise Nt is considered to be autoregressive of the order of 1, i.e., \begin{equation*} \;{N_t} = {\rm{\;\;}}\varphi {N_{t - 1}} + {\rm{\;}}{\varepsilon _t} \tag{3} \end{equation*}
View Source
where εt are independent random variables and φ is the first-order autocorrelation of the noise among successive monthly means, given as follows: \begin{equation*} \varphi \; = \;\text{Corr}({N_t};{N_{t - 1}} \tag{4} \end{equation*}
View Source
Like the seasonal component, the noise process is assumed to be stationary with −1<φ<1. Following [34], the uncertainty of the linear trend component σω can be derived as follows: \begin{equation*} {\sigma _\omega } = \left[ {\frac{{{\sigma _r}}}{{{n^{3/2}}}}\sqrt {\frac{{1 + \varphi }}{{1 - \varphi }}} } \right]\; \tag{5} \end{equation*}
View Source
with σr being the standard deviation of the detrended residuals, n is the number of months considered, and φ is the first-order autocorrelation of the residuals. The significance of the linear trend ω can then be estimated at a 95% confidence level if \begin{equation*} \left| {\frac{\omega }{{{\sigma _\omega }}}} \right| > {t_\omega } \tag{6} \end{equation*}
View Source
where σω is the uncertainty of the trend and {t_\omega }is the value of Student t-distribution for a significance level of α = 0.05 and the degrees of freedom defined by the number of months of the times series n [54], [55]. The resulting relative trend and its uncertainty are given as percent per year (%/year).
C. Analysis of Settlement Footprint Data
Time series of the settlement area per megacity were calculated from WSF evolution data for the period 1996–2015 (see Section II-D) to match with the observation period of the NO2 satellite data starting in 1996. In this study, we understand the terms “settlement footprint” or “urbanized areas” as the land directly occupied by a particular physical man-made structure. Thus, this definition represents a “settlement mask,” defined by buildings, streets, and impervious surfaces [10]. The geographical extent of each megacity was delineated using the concept of the FUA. Consequently, the yearly growth in settlement area was calculated in km2 in absolute terms and the relative growth rate in %/year.
D. Classification of Megacities According to Growth Dynamics and NO2 Trends
K-means clustering is an unsupervised machine learning technique that allows the identification of clusters, i.e., similar groups of data points within the data cloud. It is the most common partitioning method for multivariate data [56].
We apply this method to gain a classification of megacities according to growth dynamics and NO2 trends. All inputs are purely satellite-based parameters, namely, the relative tropospheric NO2 trend (%/year), the mean NO2 burden (1015 molecules/cm2), and the relative settlement growth (%/year). These data were normalized. In order to find the optimal number of clusters, the silhouette and elbow methods were used [57]. Based on these methods, and a systematic test of various cluster numbers, five clusters were determined to be most appropriate for this study.
SECTION IV.
Results
As a first illustration of the results of this study, Fig. 2 shows examples of the WSF evolution depicting the extent and yearly growth of human settlements for the megacities Chengdu, China (left column, top), Bangkok, Thailand (middle), and Lima, Peru (bottom) within their FUAs. The panels on the right display the corresponding time series of monthly mean tropospheric NO2 from 1996 to 2015 for the related FUAs. The red line illustrates the linear trend component as a result of the time series decomposition. The related relative trends (%/year) are annotated in the panels and are all significant at the 95% confidence level for the three cities. These three examples demonstrate a quite different overall development. Chengdu shows a very dynamic settlement growth and also a very strong increase in tropospheric NO2 of 22.05 ± 2.50%/year. Bangkok visually also reveals a relatively dynamic settlement growth, but just a weak increase in NO2 of 1.83 ± 0.49%/year can be observed. Contrarily, Lima exhibits almost no settlement growth within this period, but a strong increase in tropospheric NO2 pollution of 10.71 ± 1.47% year.

This diversity highlighted here asks for a more systematic analysis and presentation of the results for the 38 megacities considered. Therefore, Fig. 3(a) illustrates the full spectrum of the relative NO2 pollution trends (%/year) sorted by magnitude. In general, we find that the trends in the examined period from 1996 to 2015 vary—from strong increases to moderate declines.

Cities are sorted in descending order. Income groups are indicated according to the world's economies classification of the World Bank [52]. Asterisks in (a) indicate the significance of the trend at the 95% level.

When we compare the relative NO2 trends, the values range from an increase in Chongqing of 44.05 ± 5.86%/year to a decrease in Los Angeles of −3.19 ± 0.24%/year. The mean NO2 trend for all the 38 megacities is 5.06 ± 0.83%/year and the median is 3.16 ± 0.51%/year.
To put the trends into a socioeconomic context, the income groups are overlaid following the world's economies classification of the World Bank [49]. It is striking to see that the strongest increases in tropospheric NO2 pollution occur predominantly in megacities of upper middle-income countries (UMICs) (Chongqing, Tianjin, Chengdu, and Wuhan) followed by cities in lower middle-income countries (LMICs) (Dhaka, Lahore, and Delhi). Megacities in high-income countries (HICs), however, solely appear at the very right of the bar chart. They all show declining trends, i.e., improving NO2 air quality (Los Angeles, Chicago, Paris, Tokyo, New York, London, and Seoul). The only exception is Quezon City (Manila, Philippines), which needs further clarification.
When evaluating NO2 pollution on a per capita basis (expressed as 1015 Molecules cm-2 106 Inhabitants-1), a population-weighted metric for environmental quality, and subsequently arranging the values in descending order [see Fig. 3(b)], it becomes evident that the most elevated levels are prevalent in UMICs as well. Megacities in HICs follow in the hierarchy (Chicago, Los Angeles, and Seoul). Notably, all megacities from LMICs are found at the lowermost part of the spectrum with the lowest per capita NO2 pollution (Jakarta, Kolkata, Quezon City, Dhaka, Lagos, Ho Chi Minh City, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Delhi, Karachi, and Cairo) with the exception of Lahore, Pakistan, which deviates from this pattern and exhibits higher per capita pollution levels.
As we reveal that the per capita NO2 pollution levels in LMICs are the lowest, this should be interpreted in the context of their increasing pollution trends, suggesting potential deterioration of air quality over time. Contrarily, although megacities from HICs show decreasing trends indicating improving air quality, the per capita pollution is still among the highest.
In general, we can identify two opposing developments: if the NO2 trends of LMICs and HICs persist, with an increase and a decrease, respectively, the two groups will swap their positions in the hierarchy in the per-capita pollution [see bar chart Fig. 3(b)]. Finally, megacities from UMICs, displaying the highest positive relative NO2 trends, also exhibit high per capita pollution levels. This dichotomy highlights the intricate relationship between economic development and environmental quality, underscoring the complex nature of their interactions.
In comparison to the trends of NO2 pollution, settlement growth rates are only positive throughout the 38 megacities under analysis. Nevertheless, we also observe a high variability—from close to stagnation to extreme expansion. Fig. 4 presents the yearly growth of settlement area (expressed in km2) for a selection of the megacities and the time period of 1996 to 2015.

For this period of 20 years in the megaregion Guangzhou (Pearl River Delta), China, the highest growth in built-up area is measured. There, an expansion by 3511 km2 (approximately the area of the city/state of Berlin, Germany) is mapped, followed by Shanghai (2423 km2) and Beijing (1790 km2). In contrast, Lima and Karachi show only a small increase in built-up area of 46 km2 and 134 km2, respectively. Over the years, most megacities exhibit a straight linear increase of built-up areas. However, we also observe a pronounced flattening of the slope for Los Angeles in 2008, Chicago in 2006, and Wuhan in 2011, indicating a slowdown of the quantitative urbanization, i.e., expansion of built-up area that could be attributed to economic developments like the economic crisis in 2008 in the case of Los Angeles. On the contrary, Bangkok indicates a sharp increase in 2013 as well as Tokyo in 2014.
Based on the times series of the absolute settlement growth, the relative growth of the built-up area (%/year) was calculated for the time period from 1996 to 2015. Accordingly, in Fig. 5, the relative growth of settlement area (%/year) is presented for each megacity sorted by size. Here, Chengdu (see also Fig. 2), Chongqing, and Shanghai indicate the highest growth rates of 9.54%/year, 9.03%/year, and 7.70%/year, respectively. The lowest relative growth rates can be identified for Kinshasa (0.27%/year), Lima (0.38%/year), and Los Angeles (0.56%/year). The average relative settlement growth rate for all megacities is 2.87%/year and the median 1.85%/year. Consistently with the analysis of the NO2 trends, we put these findings in relation to the income groups following the world's economies classification of the World Bank. It can be observed that among the top ten megacities with the highest relative increase in built-up area, eight cities belong to UMICs. Actually, seven out of these ten megacities are located in China (Chengdu, Chongqing, Shanghai, Wuhan, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Beijing). In contrast, the megacities with the lowest growth rates are attributed to the HICs. Further, it should be noted that megacities of LMICs predominantly appear in the center of the spectrum except for Bengaluru, India, and Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.

Megacities from the HICs are found among the smaller growth rates, with the exception of Seoul, South Korea (HIC), on rank 12 with relative growth rates of 3.36%/year, which stands for a very dynamic expansion for a megacity of an HIC. At the lowest end of the spectrum, we find Kinshasa (LIC) that is limited in growth by the Congo River and Lima (UMIC) that is strongly confined in growth by the ocean on the one hand and the Andes mountain range on the other hand (see also lower panel of Fig. 2). From Fig. 5, we can infer a dynamic cycle pertaining to urbanization and economic development levels. Megacities in LMICs display a moderate relative settlement growth, which, on average, intensifies during the transition to the UMIC class. In the mature stages of HIC development, the relative settlement growth regresses to the lowest values, indicative of a state of saturation.
In Fig. 6, the results of the study are summarized by depicting the relative growth of settlement area (%/year) versus the relative NO2 trend (%/year) for the 38 megacities under investigation. The error bars indicate the uncertainty of the NO2 linear trend (5). The colors of the dots correspond to the income group classification of the World Bank, the size of the dots scales with the size of the FUA (km2) according to GHSL_FUA. At a glance, we can see that megacities in HICs are concentrated in the lower left part exhibiting low relative settlement growth and predominantly negative relative tropospheric NO2 trends (improving air quality). On the contrary on the upper right part of the plot, we find megacities of UMICs characterized by pronounced relative settlement growth and strong positive relative NO2 trends. By means of the identity line (red dashed line), we can initially interpret the statistical relationship of the megacities concerning settlement and pollution development. While Bengaluru, Guangzhou, Bangkok, Quezon City, and all cities of HICs display a behavior with dynamic settlement growth and small increases or decreases in NO2 pollution, Chongqing, Chengdu, Tianjin, Wuhan, Beijing, Dhaka, Lima, Tehran Lahore, and Karachi reveal a pronounced relation with disproportionately strong increases in NO2 levels. Most strikingly Lima depicts a strong increase in air pollution while the settlement growth is the second weakest among the megacities. This can be explained by a strong internal concentration and agglomeration due to as said before limited expansion possibilities due to the coast and the Andes mountain range (see Fig. 2). Concerning FUA size, we observe that the megacities with the largest sizes can be found below the identity line. Only Moscow, Lagos, and Kinshasa are characterized by a proportional behavior (considering their levels of uncertainty).

To further examine the statistical relationship between the two quantities, we tested different regression models, such as linear, quadratic, and cubic polynomial models, and evaluated their performance by the statistical parameters R-squared (R2), root-mean-squared error (RMSE), Akaike information criterion (AIC), and Bayesian information criterion (BIC). The linear regression is outperformed by both the quadratic regression and the cubic polynomial regression with R2 = 0.439 < 0.505 < 0.544, respectively. In addition, the RMSE is the lowest with the cubic fit (RMSE = 0.544), followed by the quadratic fit (RMSE = 6.177) and the linear regression (RMSE = 6.576). Regarding AIC and BIC, lower values indicate a better tradeoff between goodness of fit and model complexity. The AIC is the smallest for the cubic polynomial fit. For the BIC, the values are very close and as such an interpretation is difficult: with 260.77, the quadratic regression exhibits the lowest value compared to 261.30 for the cubic regression and 261.90 for the linear regression. Following the evaluation of the different models, we have finally chosen the cubic polynomial regression to best explain the statistical relationship between relative NO2 trends and relative settlement growth. We find that it better captures the nonlinear relationship between the variables.
We test the null hypothesis that there is no statistical relationship between settlement growth and NO2 trends. With a p-value = 0.223, we may accept the null hypothesis and suggest that there is no evidence in favor of a relationship between the two variables. Since statistical significance should be interpreted in the context of the specific analysis, we need to point out that the regression is strongly driven by a few cities with very high increases in settlement growth and NO2 pollution from 1996 to 2015, namely, Chongqing, Chengdu, and Tianjin. Although they are no “outliers” in a statistical sense, their impact on the regression analysis asks for a careful interpretation of the findings.
Despite the observed variety among the megacities indicating different stages of, e.g., socioeconomic development or green transition, the megacities of the Global North are—as outlined before—clustered in the lower left characterized by decreasing pollution levels and small relative settlement growth rates (Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, London, and Paris). To derive a more diversified spectrum of megacity types, the grouping of megacities is further examined by k-means clustering using only the EO-derived parameters, including relative growth of settlement area (%/year), relative NO2 trend (%/year), and mean tropospheric NO2 column density (1015 Molecules/cm2). The unsupervised classification distinguishes five classes (Fig. 7). Class 1 (red) comprises four large Asian megacities from HICs (Seoul) and UMICs (Beijing, Guangzhou, and Shanghai) with high tropospheric NO2 pollution and dynamic settlement growth. Class 2 (ocher) encompasses seven cities of MICs with moderate to high relative NO2 trends in the range of 6.5 ± 0.5%/year to 13.1 ± 1.2%/year (Wuhan, Dhaka, Lima, Lahore, Delhi, Jieyang, and Tehran). Class 3 (green) corresponds to the abovementioned megacities from HICs and the Global North—except for Seoul—clustered in the lower left with improving NO2 air quality and small relative settlement growth (Los Angeles, Chicago, Paris, Tokyo, New York, London, and Osaka). However, we also find in class 3 megacities from UMICs, namely, Mexico City, Moscow, and Istanbul. Class 4 (light blue) embraces the largest group of megacities. They are characterized by low to moderate relative NO2 trends and low to moderate NO2 mean values. Kinshasa from an LIC is located here. Class 5 (magenta) consists of three cities with the strongest relative NO2 increase and settlement growth that started in 1996 with low values and small urban area sizes. Finally, Fig. 7 allows for a straightforward and comprehensive classification of the development trajectories of the megacities under investigation. This classification extends to discerning whether these megacities are progressing towards improved environmental conditions, such as the green transition of the economy, or experiencing deterioration, as well as whether they are in a state of stagnation, concentration, or expansion concerning their settlement areas.

SECTION V.
Discussion
In this article, aspects of NO2 air pollution trends as well as settlement growth were systematically examined and compared for and across 38 megacities worldwide. Therefore, multiannual records of satellite-based tropospheric NO2 observations and the evolution of the settlement footprint were exploited covering a period of 20 years. A special feature in this study is the use of the spatial concept of FUAs enabling consistent comparisons without distortions due to simplified, nontransparent, or heterogeneous reference units. Compared to most previous studies, the results advance beyond a pure presentation of NO2 trends by systematically incorporating variables on urbanization, socioeconomy, and demography in the analysis.
A. Comparison of Results With Previous Studies
A critical discussion of the results obtained against the body of literature, i.e., published trends and settlement growth rates, proves difficult due to missing or different spatial reference units and differing observation periods. To overcome parts of this challenge, we suggest the application of FUAs in this study. Due to the weak representativity of ground-based measurements for the large spatial extent of megacities, a comparison against our approach that integrates over the FUAs proves difficult, too. Furthermore, a satellite-based comparison of NO2 trends and settlement growth does not yet exist to the best of the authors’ knowledge. However, we can discuss in following the tendencies and identify agreements and differences. The direct reference regarding relative NO2 trends is the work of Georgoulias et al. [40] that investigated several megacities and urban agglomerations. However, the time period differs (1996 to 2017) and no spatial definition for the derived trends is provided. Overall, the tendencies of the relative NO2 trends agree. However, the highest positive trends observed in Chongqing (44%/year), Tianjin (23.3%/year), Chengdu (22.0%/year), and Wuhan (13.1%/year) exhibit a smaller amplitude in [40] with 28.1%/year, 14.9%/year, 11.7%/year, and 7.0%/year, respectively. This could be explained by the extreme dynamic settlement growth and expansion that has not yet been considered in [40] or the extended period, including 2017, since a beginning decrease of NO2 was identified by the authors around 2012 due to the implementation of environmental measures and policies. Notably, a large deviation was found for Dhaka, where we report a relative NO2 trend of 10.8%/year compared to 16.6% in the previous study. Due to the elongated urban shape of Dhaka, the different spatial references could be an explanation. The negative relative NO2 trends can be confirmed for all megacities of HICs, with the exception of the Japanese megacities of Tokyo and Osaka, where we derived negative trends (improving air quality) compared to small positive trends in [40]. Interestingly, the exceptional behavior of Quezon City (Manila) for a megacity of LMICs with significant negative NO2 trends of −2.3%/year is confirmed by the previous study (−2.2%/year). The regressing NO2 levels in Tokyo and Los Angeles have also been identified by Bichler et al. [58] and linked to economic effects.
As for the NO2 trends, it is also difficult to directly compare settlement growth rates among different studies. Again, the spatial reference unit and the time period considered play a dominant role and may distort the numbers. With respect to relative settlement growth, the authors in [10] and [59] identified, for the periods 1990 to 2000 and 2000 to 2010, Dhaka as the megacity with the highest growth rate followed by Delhi, Jakarta, and Mumbai (where we only consider cities that occur in both studies). In the current study, Dhaka can be found in the midfield with 1.9%/year increase, while Delhi exhibits a stronger growth (2.6%/year) and Mumbai and Jakarta a weaker one with 1.8%/year and 1.5%/year, respectively. In our study, Shanghai (7.7%/year) and Beijing (5.0%/year) report the highest settlement growth among the megacities considered, compared to significantly smaller rates in [59]. However, both studies agree on the smallest growth rates for Tokyo, Buenos Aires, Rio de Janeiro, Paris, London, and Los Angeles. Notably, regarding the African megacities, Taubenböck [59] reported a similar growth dynamic for Cairo and Kinshasa, while they strongly differ in this study with Kinshasa revealing the smallest growth of all megacities (0.3%/year) and Cairo 2.3%/year, which is close to the average of 2.87%/year.
B. Strengths and Limitations of NO2 Observations
The study proves the potential of today's satellite-based observations for studying the variability of the tropospheric composition. After all, these are retrieved from space-borne instruments that have not been specifically designed for the observation of tropospheric air pollutants in the beginning, but stratospheric O3 [16], [51]. However, even for the GOME-instrument [16] that started its operation in 1995 with its coarse native spatial resolution of 320 × 40 km2, anthropogenic signals in tropospheric NO2 column densities, such as the urban weekly cycle, could be identified [26]. This substantiates the sensitivity to the lower boundary layer. Apart from the coarse spatial resolution for urban environments, further limitations of the observations used in this study comprise 1) the low temporal resolution of mainly one (morning) overpass per day due to a sun-synchronous near-polar low Earth orbit, 2) the dependence on solar-backscattered radiation, and 3) the cloud coverage that often persists in particular during pollution episodes, e.g., as a consequence of inversion conditions in the lower boundary layer. Of course, this means that daily variations or local intraurban hotspots cannot be monitored.
However, these satellite-based observations enable the quantification of global tropospheric NO2 pollution and its trends as was substantiated already by other authors, e.g., see [31], [36], and [39]. By design, one operating space-borne instrument can be considered as a global transfer standard delivering consistent and homogeneous measurements worldwide. It must be borne in mind, however, that tropospheric NO2 column densities are observed, i.e., retrieved and not the NO2 mass concentration near the ground (in ambient air) as in-situ sensors do. With these data, however, all regions and cities can be systematically examined in an area-wide, consistent way, appropriate for multitemporal and across-space comparisons [40]. Such comprehensive, spatially integrating, multitemporal datasets are an important data asset to complement ground-based measurements, as their limited spatial representativeness and often scarce availability lead to uncertainties in the interpretation.
C. Uncertainty of NO2 Observations
An important aspect of the trend analysis is the accuracy of the tropospheric NO2 dataset. Following [60], the Level 2 processing chain enables to provide a realistic error budget for tropospheric NO2 vertical column densities. The average uncertainty due to the tropospheric air mass factor over Europe is quantified by 18%–26% per pixel [61]. Other studies distinguish between uncertainties under polluted and unpolluted conditions [19], where the estimated uncertainty in the GOME-2 tropospheric NO2 column for polluted conditions ranges from 40%–80% for a single observation. However, a detailed error analysis for individual retrievals exhibits a strong variation of these estimates [60]. The total error budget comprises contributions of the geophysical parameters cloud fraction, cloud pressure, surface albedo, surface pressure, the a priori NO2 profile shape, and NOx emissions as well as aerosol-related errors. Following [19], the most important uncertainties associated with the computation of the tropospheric air mass factor are cloud fraction, surface albedo, and the a priori NO2 profile. Over polluted regions, air-mass factor errors contribute substantially to the overall error. The overall error of the tropospheric NO2 columns is driven by error propagation of the error terms listed before. Since a monthly mean dataset is built from daily observations (with sample size n) [40] and the standard error decreases by 1/√n, the overall error can be strongly reduced. For a campaign in Europe, monthly mean tropospheric columns are in very good agreement, with differences generally within 0.5 × 1015 molecules cm−2 [19]. However, with respect to the systematic error, a comparison of tropospheric NO2 column densities to global ground-based measurements shows, on average, a negative bias of typically −23 % to −37 % in clean to slightly polluted conditions, but reaching values as high as −51 % over highly polluted areas [62]. A part of the biases can be explained by differences in the representativity of the stations and different area averaging and measurement times. It is also known that errors in the tropospheric columns result from shortcomings in the horizontally coarse a priori profile representation in the underlying chemical transport model used in the retrieval [20]. Therefore, the tropospheric NO2 retrieval could be significantly improved by using a priori profiles from a CTM with much higher spatial resolution and a more realistic cloud treatment [63].
In spite of the occurrence of NO2 transport between urban areas and the surrounding regions, the relatively short atmospheric lifetime of NO2, ranging from a few hours to a day, ensures that its concentrations predominantly reflect the local strength of NO2 emissions [15], [20]. Despite the limitations, satellite data of the last decades have already been used to analyze the background pollution and the trend development around the world [31], [36], [39].
D. Strengths and Limitations of the WSF
The WSF has proven to be an effective geo dataset for large-scale mapping of human settlements at 30 × 30 m2 spatial resolution on a global scale [10], [44], [45]. With the WSF evolution available on a yearly basis, this study quantifies and analyses the horizontal expansion of megacities. We believe that this is a valid and consistent systematic approach to study this aspect of urbanization and megacity evolution. However, although the mapping product has achieved high accuracies, spatially uneven distributed classification errors have been documented [44], [46].
In addition, it is known that in certain development cycles, a vertical growth in cities cannot be neglected. In particular, this occurs with the development and strengthening of (central) business districts or large-scale housing developments with high-rise or mid-rise buildings for living. However, multitemporal settlement data, including the evolution in the third dimension with sufficient accuracy, are still absent. Latest developments, however, show that these mapping products will become more and more available [47], [64], [65], [66].
The WSF is a binary classification of “settlement” and “nonsettlement.” It is clear that urban areas and especially large urban regions, such as megacities, exhibit intraurban structural and functional variations [67]. This is also associated with different sources of NO2 emissions. Thematically, higher resolution classifications of urban structural configurations of urban landscapes are emerging [68], but are not available multitemporally for the monitoring period. This intra-urban differentiation, however, may provide new insights as a research topic in the future.
E. Multicity Studies and Spatial Consistent Concepts
Many studies concentrate on a single or a limited number of selected cities, thereby raising concerns regarding the generalizability of conclusions and the applicability of findings to other urban or regional contexts, e.g., [58]. The need for multicity studies was recently raised [69]. The current study contributes to serving this demand since it provides a systematic analysis of all megacities worldwide and empowers to derive general conclusions.
The demand for multicity studies also raises the need for appropriate and geographically consistent reference units [42]. However, geographically inconsistent spatial city extents, such as administrative areas, remain the key reference units in most studies. Therefore, it is often difficult to perform a solid comparison without distorted statistics, to draw general conclusions, or to compare results across scientific contributions. The inconsistencies of population numbers are obvious in Table I when comparing numbers from the UN [8] versus the GHSL-FUA [50] resulting from different statistical approaches and underlying spatial concepts. Contrary to previous studies on tropospheric NO2 trends, this work advances on the approach by a systematic analysis of megacities worldwide considering pollution in combination with settlement growth and the spatial concept of FUAs providing comparable geographic units. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this consistent analysis is currently not available. Furthermore, a thorough investigation of this 20-year period by means of a consistent spatial concept lays also down the fundament for follow-up studies. On the one hand, the analysis that was carried out for the FUAs of the epoch 2015 could be expanded toward their multitemporal development. On the other hand, different data-driven approaches for consistently delineating megacities, such as the degree of urbanization [70], morphological urban areas [42], or spatially continuous ways of measuring the urban and the nonurban [71], could be applied, and the stability of the results tested.
F. Dependence of Results on Time Period Considered
One might argue that the time period considered in the study is outdated and that the latest developments of air pollution levels as a consequence of implementing measures and actions are not considered, such as the policies to reduce air pollution in China or India starting around 2010. First of all, the study is based on the newest and most consistent datasets available. Second, it establishes the period from 1996 to 2015 as the baseline of the study, which results from the overlapping period of the WSF evolution (1985 to 2015) on the one hand and the beginning of tropospheric composition mapping in 1995/1996 with GOME and successors to present on the other hand. Third, evaluating past air pollutant trends in urban areas gives insight into the effectiveness of previous or recently implemented policies [29]. The results attained here can serve as the baseline to examine the effectiveness of current policies to control air pollution and urban sprawl, and possibly support measures for future policies [13]. The policy in China for example has reversed the NO2 trends partly from a strong increase into a decrease in the meantime, thanks to the implementation of mitigation measures, i.e., NOx emission reductions. This reversal cannot be appropriately acknowledged by neglecting the situation in the decades before. A thorough evaluation of trends is a prerequisite for studying the effects of policy implementations like the introduction of emission taxes on pollution levels and economic value [72]. In general, however, the study will be performed from 2016 to the present as soon as the update of the WSF evolution will be available. This will provide a better statistical basis to identify trend reversals as initiated in [40].
G. Megacity Development and Global Economic Landscape
As early as in 1992, Shukla and Parikh [73] addressed the need for an empirical examination of differences and similarities between cities from the Global North and the Global South concerning air pollution, urbanization, and city size. At that time, based quite on speculative terms, cities from less developed countries were thought to hold more potential for much greater pollution than it was anticipated for developed economies. This assumption was based on the fact that they had to go a long path of industrialization and had more limited means to mitigate environmentally detrimental concomitants of this process. Therefore, Shukla and Parikh [73] made an initial step toward assessing the magnitude of one aspect of the problem that cities from developing countries are facing, air pollution. In doing so, they conducted an empirical examination of differences and similarities between the two contexts. Cities of the Global South are characterized by greater population pressures, more rapid urbanization rates, the unbalanced growth of megacities beyond limits, and the elevated use of resources predicated by more appropriate technologies to higher development levels [8]. As presented in the current work, we can demonstrate what EO has accomplished in the meantime, by providing global datasets for comprehensive documentation and studies. As we neither use the concept of developed and developing countries nor Global North and Global South, we apply the global income classification of the World Bank that gives a much more detailed view. Furthermore, different groups are in a different stage of the economic development and as such in different technological and socioeconomic cycles.
Given the EO data records covering 20 years, we can take the opportunity to revisit development trends. In particular, by analyzing EO data records that have now become available, we retrospectively contribute to answering the hypothesis whether the sizes of megacities are dynamically growing in less developed countries and whether the growth rate in major metropolitan areas in more developed countries is declining. In general, we confirm the hypothesis, but the systematic analysis of all megacities allows us to identify exceptions. As was shown in this study, Seoul is measured with exceptionally high settlement growth rates for a city in an HIC. On the contrary, Kinshasa and Lima show the lowest relative settlement growth rates although the cities are from LICs and MICs. Despite the low settlement growth rate in the time period considered, Kinshasa is predicted by the UN to become home to 58.42 million people by 2075. Furthermore, Chicago is supposed to become the fastest developing megacity from the HICs. Other emerging megacities are Dar es Salaam, Luanda, Baghdad, Chennai, and Bogota. The continuous monitoring of the tropospheric composition and the settlement footprint will be inevitable to track the development, urbanization, and environmental impact of existing and emerging megacities worldwide.
When analyzing relative settlement growth rates and interpreting them within the global economic landscape, we need to keep their relation to the size of the FUAs under consideration in mind. Due to the large size of the FUA of Los Angeles (10 407 km2) for example and its built-up area in 1996 of 5091 km2, a relative increase in settlement area of 0.6%/year corresponds to an increment of built-up area in 2015 by 571 km2. This exceeds the increase in the settlement area of, e.g., Lagos that exhibits a higher relative growth of 3.4%/year corresponding to an increase in built-up area of 455 km2. However, for reasons of comparison, we justify the concept of relative numbers, since it is a measure of the progress of settlement growth and its impact on the megacity.
H. Transformative Aspects
Social, economic, and environmental justice and substantiating findings on air inequality are in demand. The study so far neglects transformative aspects since it currently does not consider social or socioeconomic aspects in detail. This has not yet been included in the current work for the following reasons: these aspects cannot (yet) be derived directly from or tackled with EO data. As such, the data available for megacities are derived by varying methods and are not available in a complete or consistent manner for the FUAs across the globe. The social or socioeconomic data currently available are provided for different administrative units, often only on aggregated scales such as national levels thus resulting in global data heterogeneity and uncertainty which hinders reliable conclusions. Also, the statistics of the World Bank applied in this study are based on national aggregates and should be interpreted carefully to capture or disentangle developments of an individual city. However, the significance of megacities in a country and their large share to most socioeconomic and environmental factors justify the assumptions made in this work.
I. Perspectives on Integrated Air Pollution Assessments
However, in order to consider the total air pollution situation in the megacities and to assess the associated health risks, the integration of other air pollutants, such as fine particular matter and O3, are in demand. Therefore, the comparison of megacities, as presented here, needs to be interpreted carefully. We do refer to tropospheric NO2 only. While the distributions and trends of NO2 predominantly reflect anthropogenic emission behavior, variability and changes in meteorological parameters may also play a decisive role. However, the time series analysis method used in this article should result in robust estimates and cope with seasonal and annual fluctuations [34]. Air pollution levels and the resulting (long-term) trends may also be subject to influences from other parameters and processes, such as changes in precipitation, the number of fog days or the concentration, and type of aerosols. Ultimately, more detailed and systematic studies are needed to investigate possible changes in the chemical regime of the megacities.
Current satellite missions and instruments, such as Sentinel-5P/TROPOMI and GEMS, and the upcoming missions (Sentinel-4, Sentinel-5, and TEMPO) will provide unprecedented opportunities for studying the tropospheric chemical composition. In particular, by combining LEO and GEO orbits, which will resolve diurnal cycles of the atmospheric composition, we will be able to much better observe and analyze air pollution variability in megacities and megaregions worldwide.
SECTION VI.
Conclusion
A first systematic analysis of megacities in relation to tropospheric NO2 pollution trends and settlement area growth was presented. The results advance beyond a pure presentation of NO2 trends by systematically incorporating variables on urbanization, socioeconomy, and demography in the analysis. The study covers a period of 20 years (1996 to 2015). By consistently applying the spatial concept of FUAs, we find that the megacities on average exhibit an increase in tropospheric NO2 burden of 5.06 ± 0.83%/year. The average relative settlement growth rate for the megacities is 2.87%/year. Among the 38 megacities under investigation, a wide range from increasing to decreasing NO2 pollution levels was derived and, with respect to settlement area growth, cities with stagnating to highly dynamic growth rates. In terms of absolute growth of the built-up area, we report increases from 16 km2 (Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo) and 46 km2 (Lima, Peru) to 3511 km2 (Guangzhou, China). Despite the variety, we found that the results exhibit a pronounced relation to the income groups following the world's economies classification of the World Bank. While the strongest increase of NO2 pollution and settlement growth as well as per-capita pollution occur in megacities of UMICs, megacities of LMICs are centered in the midfield of the spectrum, but with the lowest per-capita pollution levels. Megacities in HICs are predominantly characterized by the smallest relative settlement growth rates and a decrease in NO2 air pollution. Conversely, despite the decreasing trends observed in megacities from HICs, indicating advancements in air quality, the per capita pollution levels in these cities persist at some of the highest levels. This dichotomy underscores the complex interplay between economic development, urbanization, and environmental quality.
We conclude that the combination of tropospheric NO2 composition records and the WSF evolution provide essential components to develop a better understanding of the drivers and impacts of urbanization and air pollution. Regression analysis indicated a statistical relationship between relative settlement growth and relative NO2 increase among the megacities.
Furthermore, we conclude that the presented approach is suitable for identifying and comparing megacities concerning their socioeconomic development and transformation stages, such as the green transition and world economies. By a simple classification of EO-based parameters, we can label the megacities in their transformation stage. We can infer a dynamic cycle pertaining to urbanization and economic development levels.
Finally, we conclude that the findings give insight into the effectiveness of previous and current urban policies and developments, and possibly support future measures to transform existing cities according to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal SDG 11 (“Make Cities Inclusive, Safe, Resilient and Sustainable”).
