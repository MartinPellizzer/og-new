Abstract
Background:
Evidence linking gaseous air pollution to late-life brain health is mixed.
Objective:
We explored associations between exposure to gaseous pollutants and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) markers among Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study participants, with attention to the influence of exposure estimation method and confounding by site.
Methods:
We considered data from 1,665 eligible ARIC participants recruited from four US sites in the period 1987–1989 with valid brain MRI data from Visit 5 (2011–2013). We estimated 10-y (2001–2010) mean carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and 8- and 24-h ozone (O3) concentrations at participant addresses, using multiple exposure estimation methods. We estimated site-specific associations between pollutant exposures and brain MRI outcomes (total and regional volumes; presence of microhemorrhages, infarcts, lacunes, and severe white matter hyperintensities), using adjusted linear and logistic regression models. We compared meta-analytically combined site-specific associations to analyses that did not account for site.
Results:
Within-site exposure distributions varied across exposure estimation methods. Meta-analytic associations were generally not statistically significant regardless of exposure, outcome, or exposure estimation method; point estimates often suggested associations between higher NO2 and NOx and smaller temporal lobe, deep gray, hippocampal, frontal lobe, and Alzheimer disease signature region of interest volumes and between higher CO and smaller temporal and frontal lobe volumes. Analyses that did not account for study site more often yielded significant associations and sometimes different direction of associations.
Discussion:
Patterns of local variation in estimated air pollution concentrations differ by estimation method. Although we did not find strong evidence supporting impact of gaseous pollutants on brain changes detectable by MRI, point estimates suggested associations between higher exposure to CO, NOx, and NO2 and smaller regional brain volumes. Analyses of air pollution and dementia-related outcomes that do not adjust for location likely underestimate uncertainty and may be susceptible to confounding bias. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP13906
Introduction
Growing evidence links air pollution to late-life cognitive health. Currently, the strongest evidence supports an effect of particulate matter (PM) air pollution.1 In comparison with PM, fewer studies have considered gaseous pollutants; however, gaseous pollutants deserve further attention, because they also may affect brain health. Exposure to gaseous pollutants may induce systemic and cerebrovascular inflammatory and oxidative processes, which could lead to brain cell damage through damaging processes such as neuroinflammation and lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation2,3; both inflammatory and oxidative processes and brain cell damage have been suggested in several animal studies,4–18 although results were not universal.19 Further, ozone (O3) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) have been shown to affect brain amyloid levels, a hallmark of Alzheimer disease (AD), in several experimental animal studies.20–23 In addition, some observational studies, including a nationwide study in China and a study among patients in London, Ontario, Canada, suggest that exposure to certain gaseous pollutants could promote development of atherosclerosis,24,25 which can contribute to thromboembolic events and ischemic strokes. These events are commonly part of the pathophysiological process underlying vascular dementia.26
Despite the potential pathophysiological connections, the impact of gaseous pollutants on late-life cognitive or brain health remains inconclusive with conflicting results seen between existing observational studies. Studies on NO2, nitrogen oxides (NOx) or O3 and cognition, cognitive change, or dementia have shown mixed results.27–41 Studies on carbon monoxide (CO) and cognition are more limited; one study found higher exposure to ambient CO was associated with lower global cognition, attention, and executive function scores among older adults in South Korea.34 Results were mixed for two studies of CO and dementia based in Taiwan.42,43 A few studies exist on associations between gaseous pollutants and brain imaging outcomes. Results for NO2 or NOx and MRI brain changes were heterogeneous.31,32,44–48 We are aware of only one study each for O3 and CO and brain imaging. No significant results were found in a study of O3 and brain volumes and subclinical infarcts in a subcohort of the Northern Manhattan Study.44 CO exposure was associated with higher risk of brain infarcts in a study based in China.46
Overall, the research linking gaseous pollutants to late-life cognitive health is inconclusive and limited for certain pollutants such as O3 and CO, and few studies have quantified the association between gaseous pollutants and MRI biomarkers, which provide an opportunity to quantify pathogenic change in vivo. Here, we build on prior work by our team in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study, which considered associations between fine PM [PM with aerodynamic diameter ≤2.5μm (PM2.5)] and course PM with aerodynamic diameter ≤10μm (PM10) exposures and MRI measures of brain health,49 by quantifying the associations between gaseous pollutants (NOx, NO2, O3, and CO) and MRI markers of neurodegeneration and cerebrovascular disease. In addition, we explore several methodological questions related to the study of air pollution and brain health. Specifically, we explore the possible impact of spatial confounding, a potential issue in air pollution–health studies,50 by conducting studies stratified by study site and without accounting for site. Further, given existence of multiple air pollution exposure estimation methods, we compare gaseous pollutant concentrations across several estimation methods and assess whether choice of method impacts results.
Materials and Methods
Cohort
The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) cohort study comprises 15,792 individuals recruited from 1987 to 1989 at 45 to 64 y of age, from Forsyth County, North Carolina (NC); Jackson, Mississippi (MS); suburbs of Minneapolis, Minnesota (MN); and Washington County, Maryland (MD). Race was self-reported through selection from a predetermined list (“American Indian or Alaskan Indian,” “Asian,” “Black,” “White”); data on ethnicity were not collected. Three of the four ARIC sites are racially homogenous: Almost all participants in the MN and MD sites are White, and all participants in the MS site are Black. Participants have completed multiple study visits since recruitment. ARIC Visit 5 participants at all four sites were invited to participate in a 3 Tesla (3T) MRI in 2011–2013 using a stratified random sampling approach, which selected all persons with a previous ARIC study brain MRI or cognitive impairment defined by low or declining cognitive test scores at Visit 5, and a random sample of participants in strata defined by age (above and below age 80 y) at each of the four study sites to ensure adequate representation by age and site.51 This approach allows weighting back to the full Visit 5 ARIC sample using cohort-derived weights and allays concerns about selection bias and lack of generalizability that arise when MRI samples are overly enriched in young, cognitively intact individuals.
Exclusions
Our sample was restricted to ARIC participants who completed 3T brain MRIs at Visit 5 (2011–2013, n=1,978). After excluding participants from small race–site categories (non-White in MD or MN, non-White or non-Black in NC, n=15, given insufficient numbers to control for confounding by other race-site groups); history of tumor, surgery, or radiation to the head, multiple sclerosis, or implausible estimated total intracranial volume (n=17); missing total brain volume (n=6); missing air pollution concentrations (Method 1, 12km, n=83); missing APOE genotype information (n=64); missing neighborhood socioeconomic position (SEP) at Visit 4 (1996–1998, n=124); or missing data on other key covariates (n=4); 1,665 participants were eligible for inclusion in analyses. Sample sizes after excluding persons with missing exposure data for other exposure estimation methods varied by method (described below): n=1,580 for Method 1, 1.33km; n=1,608 for Method 1, 4km; n=1,665 for Method 1, finest available; n=1,577 for Method 2, and n=1,665 for Method 3. Sample sizes for each analysis further varied by outcome based on variability in missingness of outcome data across outcomes.
Gaseous Air Pollutant Exposures
We used three different approaches to estimate 10-y average air pollution concentrations, which were linked to geocoded participant residential addresses. Addresses were collected at ARIC visits and annual telephone interviews and geocoded with high accuracy by a commercial vendor.52,53 Pollutants of interest included NO2, NOx, 8-h and 24-h O3, and CO. Not all exposures were estimated by all methods, as detailed below.
Method 1 (M1).
Method 1 estimated annual concentrations of NO2, NOx, 8-h and 24-h O3, and CO. In brief, this method uses a chemical transport model, the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model, and two different emission inventories [the US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) National Emissions Inventory (NEI) and the European Union Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR) emissions inventory] to estimate two sets of concentrations (CMAQ-NEI, CMAQ-EDGAR) for 4 representative months of each year, which were averaged to annual means. Use of 4 representative months, rather than modeling the full 12 months, reduced computational time with little impact on accuracy of resulting annual averages. The weighted average of the CMAQ-NEI and CMAQ-EDGAR annual average concentrations was then adjusted with an observational data fusing technique to maximize agreement with observed concentrations; this approach spatially interpolates differences between estimated and observed concentrations at known spatial locations to create and apply adjustments to all gridded exposure concentrations allowing for correction of systematic bias.54,55 Observational data came from US EPA Air Quality Standards (AQS) Data Mart. Method 1 was used to generate gridded concentrations of 1.33km (M1_1km), 4km (M1_4km), and 12km (M1_12km) grid cell sizes in nested domains centered on the ARIC sites (Figure 1). In addition to considering resolution-specific concentrations, we derived a concentration (M1_f) using the finest spatial resolution available for each participant (i.e., 1.33km if available, otherwise 4km if available, otherwise 12km). Participants were matched to concentrations based on the grid cell in which their addresses were located. Cross-validation spatial R2s relative to observed concentrations for the estimated annual average concentrations from 1990 to 2012 within the domains centered on the four ARIC sites were 0.50, 0.50, and 0.59 for 12km, 4km, and 1.33km resolution CO, respectively; 0.72, 0.49, and 0.67 for 12km, 4km, and 1.33km resolution NO2, respectively; and 0.56 and 0.60 for 12km and 4km resolution 24-h O3, respectively.

Method 2 (M2).
The second method (M2) used ArcGIS 10.2 to estimate daily concentrations of NO2, NOx, and 24-h O3 via national log-normal ordinary kriging.56–58 Daily concentrations from monitors with 18 or more hours of AQS data per day were used to derive daily means. To predict unobserved air pollution concentrations, the estimated spherical semivariogram, representative of the observed estimated spatial autocorrelation was used, with measurement error set to 0. The daily concentrations were averaged to create annual means. Point-level concentrations were matched to participant addresses. Average root mean square standardized values for 2000, 2005, and 2010 ranged from 0.85 to 0.92 for NO2, 0.89 to 0.95 for NOx, and 0.76 to 0.82 for O3.59
Method 3 (M3).
Method 3 (M3) derived 1-wk estimated concentrations for NO2 and 24-h O3 using regionalized universal kriging with land-use regression (LUR) and partial least squares regression (PLSR) derived separately for nine US regions.60,61 Input data included monitor data from the AQS, Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), and New York City Community Air Survey, and smoothed temporal trend basis functions were derived using monitors active over substantial periods of time. Monthly concentrations provided to our research team were averaged to create annual means. Point-level exposures were matched to participant addresses. Cross-validation spatial R2 relative to observed concentrations for annual average concentrations calculated nationwide separately by calendar year from 1990 to 2010 ranged from 0.79 to 0.86 for NO2 and 0.66 to 0.73 for 24-h O3.
Exposure measures.
For each method, we averaged the estimated annual mean air pollution concentrations over 10 y from 2001 to 2010 at geocoded participant addresses; if mean concentrations were missing for any year from 2001 to 2010, the 10-y mean exposure was set to missing. This approach resulted in exclusion of only 1.8% of otherwise eligible persons with at least 1 y of Method 1, 12km data between 2001 and 2010.
Brain MRI Outcomes
Details about the 3T MRI scanning procedures and imaging analysis have been previously described.49,51,62,63 MRI scans were completed at each study site. Cortical volumes were calculated using the FreeSurfer brain imaging software (version 5.1) developed by the Laboratory for Computational Neuroimaging at the Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging, and an algorithm derived by the Mayo Clinic MRI Reading site was used to quantify white matter hyperintensity volume. Both cortical and subcortical infarcts were identified and quantified by trained technicians and confirmed by radiologists.
We considered the following brain MRI outcomes: total brain volume; cortical volumes for several regions of interest (ROIs: frontal, occipital, temporal and parietal lobes, hippocampus, deep gray matter, and an AD signature ROI63 that includes the hippocampus, parahippocampal cortex, entorhinal cortex, inferior parietal lobule, precuneus, and cuneus); white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume; and the presence or absence of microhemorrhages, infarcts, lacunes, and severe WMH. We defined severe WMH as presence of WMH volume >5% of total white matter volume.
Covariates
Covariates included self-reported age in years and total intracranial volume64 at Visit 5, self-reported sociodemographics from Visit 1 (study site and race—Black or White, which were combined into a race–site variable, MS-Black, NC-Black, NC-White, MD-White, and MN-White because of racial homogeneity within study sites), gender (male/female), education [less than high school, high school/general education diploma (GED)/vocational school, at least some college]; APOE e4 allele status based on genotyping (0 and ≥1 allele); and self-reported smoking status (current, former, and never) and neighborhood-level SEP summary scores at Visit 4.65 Exposure to gaseous air pollutants and incidence of dementia have been shown to differ by race in the United States, which suggests possible confounding bias in the absence of adjustment.66,67
The neighborhood-level SEP summary score was derived using six census-tract level variables from the US Census of Population and Housing’s summary files (census year 2000), geographically linked to accurately geocoded participant addresses,52,53 log-transformed median household income; percentage of households with interest, dividends, rent income; % of adults 25 y and older with a high school degree; percentage of adults 25 y and older with a college degree; percentage of population 16 y and older with professional, managerial, or executive occupation; and log-transformed median value of owner-occupied housing units. Each census-tract level variable was z-transformed, then summed to create summary z-scores. For descriptive statistics presented, the z-score sum was then z-transformed based on the mean and standard deviation (SD) of participants at Visit 4 to allow interpretation in sample-specific SD units. Covariates included in the analyses were chosen because they were assumed to be likely confounders of the relationship between gaseous air pollution exposure and brain health, given sociodemographic patterning of air pollution exposures and risk of cognitive impairment.
Statistical Analysis
We present descriptive statistics by study site for all outcomes and covariates. To examine agreement between gaseous air pollution concentrations estimated using different methods, we compared concentrations using heat maps of pairwise spatial R2s for all sites combined and stratified by site.
We used linear regression to quantify associations between gaseous air pollutant exposures and volumetric MRI outcomes, and we used logistic regression to quantify associations with dichotomous markers of cerebrovascular disease. Because of the skewed distribution of WMH volume, we log2-transformed this outcome before analysis and present results as the percentage change in WMH volumes for a given air pollution exposure contrast. We standardized continuous outcome variables for analysis using the sample SD and mean; thus, results are interpreted as a difference in SD units for a given difference in air pollution exposures. For volumes other than WMH, negative regression coefficients (betas), indicating smaller volume with higher exposure, are suggestive of a harmful effect of air pollution; the interpretation is the opposite for WMH volume. For dichotomous outcomes, odds ratios >1 suggest a harmful effect.
All analyses were weighted to account for the Visit 5 MRI stratified random sampling strategy and refusals using weights provided by the ARIC study and were adjusted for age, race, gender, formal education level, smoking status, APOE4 allele status, neighborhood-level SEP, and total estimated intracranial volume. We performed each analysis by study site, then combined estimates with random effects meta-regression and evaluated heterogeneity of effect using the I2 test. When air pollutant concentrations were available from more than one method, we compared findings to understand the impact of choice of air pollution estimation approach on our conclusions. Finally, to understand the potential impact of spatial confounding, driven by observed patterns of exposure and outcome among sites and theoretical concerns about unmeasured confounding by contextual factors for which site is a proxy, we completed analyses in a combined-site sample not adjusting for study site.
We report 95% confidence intervals, and we present results for an exposure contrast of 30 ppb for CO, 2 ppb for NO2, 5 ppb for NOx, and 1 ppb for all measures of O3, to ensure estimated effects of exposure contrasts are in the general range of the observed site-specific interquartile range (IQR) of 10-y average exposures observed for each pollutant. The institutional review boards of all participating institutions approved the ARIC study, and participants provided written informed consent at each study visit. Analyses and figures were completed using SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute Inc.), Stata/MP (version 16.1; StataCorp), and R (version 4.1.0; R Development Core Team).

Mean±SD concentrations for each pollutant are shown in Table 2. By study site, variability in exposures was usually smallest for the MS site. Across methods, average NO2 and NOx concentrations were generally lowest for MS and highest for MN, whereas the opposite was seen for 8-h and 24-h O3, where concentrations generally were lowest for MN and highest for MS and NC. Likewise, average concentrations of CO were lowest for MN or MD and highest for NC. With exceptions for 24-h O3, Method 2 concentrations, where available, were notably higher and less variable than those of other methods. NO2 and NOx concentrations were negatively correlated with 8- and 24-h O3 concentrations for Method 1 and Method 3, where available (Table S1).

Pairwise spatial R2 between methods for each of 10-y NO2 and 24-h O3 are provided in Figure 2, and corresponding statistics for all other exposures are available in Figures S1–S3. Here we consider a strong R2 as ≥0.75, moderate as 0.5–0.74, and weak as <0.5. Among the Method 1 resolutions (chemical transport modeling plus observation data fusing based method), relative agreement was usually moderate to strong for NO2 and NOx across and within site, but more often weak within site for CO and O3. Method 2 (national log-normal ordinary kriging) generally had weak relative agreement with other methods. Comparing Method 3 (regionalized universal kriging with land-use regression and partial least squares regression) to Method 1, relative agreement was often moderate to strong both within and among sites for NO2, with the exception of weak agreement for MS, but was usually weak for 24-h O3, except for moderate to strong agreement for MN.

Regression results for all exposure/outcome combinations are available in Excel Table S1. Although estimated associations were variable across sites, meta-analytic summary estimates between 10-y mean concentrations and brain MRI markers were primarily null, with a few exceptions. Higher Method 1, 4km concentrations of NO2, NOx, and CO were significantly or marginally associated with smaller temporal lobe volumes in meta-analytic summary estimates (Figures 3 and 4; Figure S4); point estimates were similar but not statistically significant for meta-analytic summary estimates from alternate Method 1 resolutions. Corresponding meta-analytic associations with Method 2 and Method 3 NO2 concentrations were also in the same direction although not statistically significant. Similarly, associations across Method 1 and Method 3 estimation methods for NO2 and NOx with deep gray volume, hippocampal volume, frontal lobe volume, and AD signature ROI volume generally suggested smaller volumes with higher concentrations (Figure 3; Figure S4: Excel Table S1). Although there were some negative associations seen for NO2 or NOX and other brain volumes, including a statistically significant association for Method 2 NO2 and parietal lobe volume, results were less consistent. Associations of Method 1 CO with frontal lobe volume were also in the harmful direction, and NO2 and NOx associations suggested greater presence of microbleeds across estimation methods with the exception of Method 2 for NO2 (Excel Table S1).

O3 meta-analytic results differed notably in several, often unexpected, ways. Higher 8- and 24-h O3 and temporal lobe and deep gray volume associations were often in the protective direction, although not statistically significant, suggesting larger volumes were associated with higher concentrations (Figure S5; Figure 5). One exception was the statistically significant association between Method 1, finest resolution 8-h O3 and deep gray matter volume in the harmful direction. In addition, higher Method 1, 4km 8-h or 24-h O3 concentrations were statistically significantly associated with reduced likelihood of microbleeds, contrary to our hypotheses; point estimates were similar but not statistically significant for associations using alternate Method 1, Method 2, or Method 3 concentrations, when available (Excel Table S1).

More notable differences in the direction, magnitude, and precision of associations by estimation method were seen within site (Excel Table S1). For example, Method 2 NO2 and NOX associations with temporal lobe and deep gray volumes for NC were in the opposite direction of results from the other methods, and estimates of associations between Method 2 NO2 and NOX exposures and temporal lobe and deep gray volumes were substantially more imprecise and often of different magnitude than estimates using other methods in all sites (Figure 3; Figure S4). In comparison with the meta-analytic estimates, analyses that did not adjust for study site consistently produced the most seemingly precise and most frequently statistically significant associations, which may have resulted from the underestimation of true uncertainty (Figure 6; Excel Table S1). In some cases, the associations were similar across analyses (e.g., CO and NO2 temporal lobe volume), suggesting limited confounding by site, whereas in other cases the associations differed notably, even changing direction as with Method 1 24-h O3 and temporal lobe volume or CO and frontal lobe volume, suggesting strong confounding by site (Figure 6; Excel Table S1).

Discussion
Results suggested associations between higher NO2, NOx, and CO concentrations and smaller regional brain (particularly temporal lobe) volumes, based on directions of associations, which were occasionally statistically significant depending on the exposure estimation method considered. Associations with estimated concentrations from the national log-normal ordinary kriging method, Method 2, often differed in direction and precision from those estimated by other methods, whereas associations with estimated concentrations from the regionalized universal kriging with land-use regression and partial least squares regression method, Method 3, were usually more similar to those relying on Method 1 (which involved chemical transport modeling with observation data fusing) but were uniformly null in meta-analyses. Despite this, the consistent direction for some of the meta-analytic exposure–outcome associations, in particular for NO2 and NOx and sometimes CO, is notable and deserves consideration in other samples. Because major sources of NO2, NOx and CO in the United States include emissions from vehicles or machinery68,69 and other air pollutants such as black carbon or trace metals are also associated with traffic-related air pollution, it is possible that these gaseous pollutants are proxies for other, harmful pollutants.
Associations with temporal lobe volume are consistent with a contribution of gaseous air pollution to dementia risk. The temporal lobe includes structures, including the hippocampus, that participate in memory, emotions, language, and sensory processing.70 Temporal lobe (including medial temporal lobe) atrophy is common in people with dementia, particularly AD dementia, but can also be seen in patients without dementia or with other neurodegenerative processes.71,72 The associations found for temporal lobe volume could be driven in part by lower volume of the hippocampus, which is part of the temporal lobe, in cases where we also found results suggestive of lower hippocampal volume.
Individual types of gaseous pollutants are not heterogeneous mixtures so we would not anticipate regional differences in effect based on individual pollutant characteristics. However, we found that the direction and magnitude of effects were not consistent across sites. In several cases, including most results for NO2, NOx, CO and both temporal lobe and deep gray matter volume, the greatest magnitude of harmful associations were seen for the NC site. Further, possibly because of greater exposure variability and resulting greater precision for the NC site, these results were more often statistically significant than for other sites. Such differences by site could reflect true effect modification or could be driven by unmeasured confounding or differences in power to detect an effect across sites. In the case of MS, the associations suggesting greater odds of microbleeds and severe WMH with higher exposure to CO, NOx, and NO2 could indicate racial differences in health or exposure, because all participants in the MS site are Black, whereas the remaining sites comprised all or primarily White participants. Effect modification by race for the association between NO2 and dementia and AD was previously found in a US cohort study, with an increased hazard at higher exposures for Black vs. White individuals.38 However, we are cautious to draw conclusions due to the homogeneity of race within ARIC sites and the distribution of ARIC sites within broader spatial patterns of health and other factors in the United States (e.g., the MS site is the only ARIC site in the “stroke belt,” an area in the Southeast with high stroke mortality73) It will be important for future studies without the race-site homogeneity limitation to explore this further.
We also found some counterintuitive, but not statistically significant, results suggesting a protective effect of O3 on brain volume and microbleeds. One possible explanation for the unexpected O3 results is that higher O3 concentrations are correlated with lower concentrations of other pollutants. Because of chemical interactions between O3 and NO2 and NOx, concentrations of NO2 and NOx may be lower in areas with higher O3 and vice versa under certain conditions.74 Therefore, the protective associations we see with O3 could be driven by the inverse correlations with NO2 and NOx, given harmful NO2 and NOx associations with several outcomes. Alternatively, this pattern could be related to misclassification or chance findings, the latter given the multiple analyses completed.
Only a few studies have considered whether gaseous air pollutants are associated with brain changes using MRIs in adults, with mixed results. Analyses of 590 participants in the 1000BRAINS Cohort found an association between lower right posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus indices and 3-y average (2006–2008) exposure to NO2 and NOx, and lower right inferior parietal lobule indices and exposure to NOx,32 at odds with our lack of consistent support for an association between these pollutants and parietal lobe volume but consistent with a suggested association with the AD signature ROI. Also differing from our study findings, higher 3-y average (2015–2017) NO2 and CO exposure were associated with higher risk of brain infarcts in a study based in China of 1,400,503 participants who underwent MRIs in routine health examinations.46 Further, a study of a cohort among four cities in the Republic of Korea (n=957)—the only other study we found that considered the temporal lobe as a whole—found lower frontal, temporal, parietal, insular and global cortical thickness, and reduced amygdala, pallidum, caudate, thalamus and nucleus acumbens subcortical volume with higher 5-y average NO2 exposure.75
Another study that examined air pollution, physical activity, and brain volumes in the UK Biobank (n=8,600) found 1-y average (2010) NO2 was associated with smaller gray matter volume; NOx results were not statistically significant.47 However, two other UK Biobank studies (n=18,27845,48) and one study of a cohort from Barcelona, Spain (n=228),31 found no statistically significant associations between 1-y (2010) or 2-y (2013–2014) NO2 or NOx and brain volumes,31,45,48 and a meta-analysis of the association between NO2 and hippocampal volume across three of these studies31,45,75 found no association.76 Despite these findings, several of the studies found negative directions of associations for NO2 and/or NOx and hippocampal volume or left hippocampal volume, which is similar to our findings for hippocampal volume and temporal lobe volume (of which the hippocampus is a part).31,45,75 In addition, a study that involved 1,075 participants from the Northern Manhattan Study MRI subcohort found no significant associations between 1-y average NO2, NOx, or O3 and brain volumes or presence of subclinical brain infarcts.44 Notably, the temporal differences in years and averaging periods (ranging from 1 to 5 y) in these studies limits comparison of results among studies.
Our analyses indicate that different exposure estimation approaches yield gaseous air pollutant concentrations that differ in important ways. The range of Method 2 concentrations was notably narrow across pollutants within site, probably due to sole reliance on data from sparsely located monitors incapable of fully capturing variability within small regions. Likely related to this, relative agreement between Method 2 and the other methods was often weak both within and across sites, reflecting the fact that Method 2 produced patterns of exposures that differed from the other two methods both within and across sites. It is interesting to note that Method 1 and Method 3, which use fundamentally different approaches, produced similar patterns of exposure in some cases, but not in others. Relative agreement for NO2 concentrations was usually moderate to strong both among and within most sites. To the contrary, relative agreement between Method 1 and Method 3 for 24-h O3 was weak across sites but ranged from weak to strong in within-site analyses, depending on the site. Although cross-validation statistics were available for the estimation methods, there are limitations to comparing across methods, for example, due to use of different monitors for Method 1 vs. Method 3. The among-method differences seen suggest that choice of method may matter in this and other research contexts. In studies where participants are from smaller geographic areas, lack of exposure variability may be a limitation of exposure estimation methods based exclusively on sparsely located monitor data; including concentrations estimated using other methods may be warranted.
Our primary analyses were conducted stratified by site, in acknowledgment of the potential for confounding by site and related contextual factors or population-level variation in individual factors. We believe that this approach is necessary to adequately adjust for confounding, but we also acknowledge that it also has the effect of limiting the range of exposures and thus the power of analyses to detect an effect77 or explore potential for nonlinear associations. Analyses that did not adjust for site, which are not recommended, suggested the presence of an association more often than analyses that combined site-stratified estimates by meta-analysis, likely reflecting a combination of additional precision associated with the greater range in exposure achieved when combining sites without accounting for site and, in some but not all instances, bias due to spatial confounding. This suggests that analyses of air pollution exposures and dementia-related outcomes may be susceptible to spatial confounding or a bias akin to the ecological fallacy, to the extent that between-site patterns are not replicated within site.
Our study had several strengths. First, our study included a relatively large number of persons who had an MRI, and this MRI substudy was nested within a community-based cohort, with systematic oversampling of persons with cognitive impairment and implementation of weighting to recover associations in the full Visit 5 analytical sample. These characteristics suggest broad generalizability of findings and limit concerns about selection bias. We also considered multiple exposure estimation methods, including differing resolutions of Method 1, providing insight into agreement among concentrations across approaches and allowing examination of whether choice of exposure estimation method impacted associations between gaseous pollutants and MRI outcomes. Given the multisite nature of the study, we were specifically able to investigate the impact of confounding by study site. However, we also looked for patterns in directions of estimates and did not strictly focus on statistical significance in our interpretations.
Our study also has limitations. Although accounting for study site helped address potential confounding, it also reduced the range of exposures informing estimates and thus precision and power to detect effects. Were site not a confounder, this reduction may have led to us missing associations. Race was homogenous for most sites and limited to Black and White participants, limiting generalizability and assessment of effect modification by race. We evaluated associations with MRI markers at a single time point, rather than within-person change, which is more likely to capture ongoing pathological processes. We also only looked at a 10-y average for exposure and did not account for other averaging periods or lags, which may not adequately capture changes over time, shorter periods of higher exposure, or other critical periods of exposure. However, we chose this averaging period based on the theory that long-term prior exposures are most relevant to brain MRI findings, given they represent accumulation of damage that is known to accumulate slowly in many neurodegenerative processes, including many forms of dementia. Finally, we focused on ambient exposures at residential addresses, which are unlikely to fully capture variation in individual-level exposures given time–activity patterns. However, this approach has been sufficient to establish health effects of air pollution exposures on other health outcomes69,78,79 and remains informative to policy, particularly setting of ambient air quality standards.
In conclusion, this study illustrates differences in estimated air pollution concentrations across approaches and found limited suggestion of an effect of gaseous air pollution exposures on MRI markers of dementia-related brain changes, which should be interpreted with caution where there are inconsistencies in findings, especially considering study limitations. It also suggests that spatial confounding may contribute to heterogenous findings in other related studies. Evaluation in studies with larger samples, greater exposure variability, and consideration of other averaging periods of exposure are warranted.
