In conclusion, this study provides new insights into the atmospheric circulation and composition of TRAPPIST-1e, a promising target for future research. The results highlight the potential for orography to shape atmospheric dynamics on tidally locked planets and underscore the importance of careful consideration of model parameters when studying exoplanet atmospheres. Future studies will continue to refine our understanding of these complex systems, ultimately informing the interpretation of observations and paving the way for new discoveries in astro-physics.
