The developed ozone DIAL system emits three laser beams at wavelengths of 276 nm, 287 nm, and 299 nm using the stimulated Raman effect of carbon dioxide (CO2). The backscattering signals are collected by a 250 mm telescope and separated by a grating spectrometer. To invert ozone concentration, wavelength pairs are chosen based on altitude ranges: 276 nm–287 nm for altitudes below 600 m and 287 nm–299 nm for altitudes above 600 m. Additionally, the system is designed to consider aerosol interference and statistical error.
