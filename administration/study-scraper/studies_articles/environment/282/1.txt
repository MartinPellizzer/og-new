The study used DEMATEL to analyze the interactions between variables affecting air pollution risk in an industrial zone. The data was collected from various sources, including industrial complexes, ports, and environmental monitoring stations. The researchers identified 17 variables as causal factors and 14 variables as effect factors. The fuzzy DEMATEL method was employed to analyze the relationships between these variables.
