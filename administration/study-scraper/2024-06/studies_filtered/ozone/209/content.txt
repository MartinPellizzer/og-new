Abstract
Purpose of Review
The air quality in Taiwan is significantly impacted by ambient ozone (O3) pollution, which poses a challenge in terms of control due to the involvement of precursors and influencing factors in its photochemical process. This review investigates the measures that have been implemented in Taiwan over the past two decades to address this issue and evaluate their effectiveness in reducing O3 concentrations. Furthermore, it highlights relevant studies that have employed advanced methods to examine the O3 problem.
Recent Findings
Comprehending the complex formation of O3 and its driving factors is crucial in efficiently managing O3 pollution. Nevertheless, accurately quantifying the impacts of these factors can be challenging due to their interconnections. To bridge this gap in knowledge, conducting a robust causality analysis becomes imperative to accurately quantify the causal influence of major factors. Furthermore, eliminating seasonal variations can improve the precision and accuracy of trend analyses concerning long-term changes in O3 concentrations. Deep learning, in particular, holds significant advantages in predicting O3 concentrations as it can capture non-linear and long-term memory characteristics effectively.
Summary
In summary, attaining acceptable O3 levels in Taiwan is challenging due to its geographical location, which makes it susceptible to air pollution from both local sources as well as distant upwind areas. The utilization of advanced methods is essential for comprehensively studying the evolution of O3 and formulating effective mitigation measures. While there is a necessity to develop new analytical methods, implementing existing robust methodologies can also provide valuable insights into the dynamics and impacts of O3. By leveraging these approaches, we can enhance our comprehension of O3 pollution in Taiwan and develop effective strategies to mitigate its harmful effects on air quality.
