The discussion of this study highlights the importance of accurate ro-vibrational energy levels in understanding the molecular structure and behavior of ozone. The results demonstrate the ability of the MARVEL analysis to provide reliable and consistent energy levels, which can be used for a range of applications including atmospheric science, spectroscopy, and quantum mechanics. The comparison with EH energy levels and variational nuclear motion calculations provides further validation of the accuracy and reliability of the MARVEL energies.
