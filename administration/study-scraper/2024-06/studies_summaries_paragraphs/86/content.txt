Here is a summary of the study in one detailed paragraph, focusing on ozone-related information:

The photocatalytic ozonation process was employed to remove Acid Blue 113 dye from a solution using a magnesium oxide-based nanocatalyst. The nanocomposite catalyst, Fe2O3/MgO/MoS2, was synthesized and optimized for the process using response surface methodology (RSM). The results showed that the optimal conditions for dye removal included pH 2.27, 8.6 mg of catalyst, ozone concentration of 0.2 mg/L/h, and a treatment time of 26 min, resulting in 99.3% dye removal. Additionally, the nanocatalyst demonstrated high reusability and stability after eight consecutive cycles, indicating its potential for industrial applications to treat dye-containing effluent.
