Heavy naphtha desulfurization is a critical process in petroleum refining to remove sulfur-containing compounds from fuel products. Sulfur removal is essential to meet environmental regulations and ensure public health and safety. Non-thermal plasma technology has been gaining attention as a promising method for sulfur removal due to its high efficiency and minimal waste generation. This study investigates the use of ozone generated via dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma reactor for heavy naphtha desulfurization.
