The results showed that anthropogenic VOCs (AVOC) enhanced daily maximum 8-hour average ozone in Pasadena by 12 ppb, while biogenic VOCs (BVOCs) contributed 8 ppb. VCPs represented the largest fraction of ozone influenced by AVOCs at 44%, followed by cooking and fossil fuel VOCs, which were comparable at 28% each. The study also found that NOx sensitivity analyses along trajectory paths indicated a spatial and temporal variation in the photochemical regime of ozone.
