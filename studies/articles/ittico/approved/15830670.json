    "abstract": "The purpose of the present study was to determine the effect of ozone pretreatment of live fish on their shelf life and storage characteristics during storage at 0 and 5 degrees C. The evaluation included sensory, chemical, physical, and bacteriological tests at set intervals throughout a storage period of 30 days under two temperature regimes (0 and 5 degrees C). The results of the sensory tests showed that ozone pretreatment of live tilapia prolonged their shelf life by 12 days and improved their quality characteristics during storage at 0 degrees C for 30 days. These results were corroborated by the bacteriological tests. The sensory qualities of ozone-treated tilapia stored at 5 degrees C became unacceptable 3 days later than those of control fish. Although the most important factor affecting the fish shelf life is storage temperature, the combination of ozone pretreatment with storage at 0 degrees C appears to be a promising means of prolonging the shelf life."
