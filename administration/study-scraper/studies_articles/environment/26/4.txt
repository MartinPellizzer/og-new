In conclusion, this study provides a comprehensive assessment of surface O3 pollution in China over the past two decades. Our results demonstrate the importance of fine-scale estimations in understanding the spatial patterns of O3 concentrations. The implications of our findings emphasize the need for more effective policies to reduce emissions and mitigate the negative impacts of O3 pollution on environmental health. By continuing to monitor and analyze surface O3 concentrations, we can better understand the complexities of this pollutant and inform evidence-based decisions to protect public health.
