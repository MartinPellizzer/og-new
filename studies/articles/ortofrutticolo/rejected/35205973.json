    "abstract": "There is limited information on the health effects of apple peel taken from 'Fuji' (<i>Malus pumila</i> Mill) apples washed with ozonated water. To clarify the health-promoting effects of peel, the triterpenoids (ursolic acid and oleanolic acid) were quantified with gas chromatograph-mass spectrometry. Anti-obesity effects of apple peel extract on the 3T3-L1 pre-adipocyte cell were compared with apple flesh, whole apple, and ursolic acid. The peel extract treatment with 3.30 \u00b1 1.05 \u03bcM of ursolic acid significantly suppressed (<i>p</i> < 0.05) the lipid accumulation compared with the content in flesh, and a similar level was reached in the 5 \u03bcM ursolic acid positive control group. In the peel extract and ursolic acid treatment groups, the C16:0 concentration was significantly inhibited (<i>p</i> < 0.05), implying the anti-obesity effect of ursolic acid on the 3T3-L1 cell. Moreover, apple peel contributed 41% of the total flavonoids content and 31% of the phenolic contents of the whole apple, but only accounted for less than 10% of the whole apple (weight basis). This study's results offer basic data on pre-washed apple as a health functional food, offering information about the health benefits of apple peel, calculated based on the partial ratio in the whole apple."
