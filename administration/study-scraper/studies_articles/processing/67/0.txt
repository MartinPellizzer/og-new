This study focuses on developing a mathematical model for the ozone-assisted cerium redox process to remove surface contaminants from stainless steel components. The process is commonly used in nuclear facilities to decontaminate equipment and surfaces exposed to radionuclides. The goal of this research is to optimize the process parameters to achieve efficient and effective surface removal.
