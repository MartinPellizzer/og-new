The results of this study show that the enhanced HNO3 concentrations in the high-latitude lower stratosphere significantly increased nitric acid. Using the novel methodology, it was found that 82% of LNAT condensed on bushfire aerosols and rapidly converted to 77% of ice PSCs, resulting in an anomalous high areal coverage of ice PSCs. These findings highlight the primary formation pathways of ice and LNAT and provide insights into simulating PSC formation and denitrification processes better in climate models.
