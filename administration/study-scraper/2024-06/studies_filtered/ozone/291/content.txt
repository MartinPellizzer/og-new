Abstract
Context
Freon, a greenhouse gas that contributes to the depletion of the ozone layer, has been the subject of investigation in this study. The catalytic hydrolysis enhancement of CFC-12 by ZrO2 was examined using a density functional theory approach. A detailed reaction mechanism and a new reaction pathway were proposed. The study found that CFC-12 is more likely to be adsorbed on the ZrO2 surface in the CFC-12-TO(F) configuration, while H2O is more likely to be adsorbed on the ZrO2 surface in the H2O-TO(H) configuration. Additionally, H2O replaces CFC-12 on the surface of ZrO2. The hydrolysis of CFC-12 is primarily determined by the first dechlorination process, while the defluorination process is comparatively easier. ZrO2 has a catalytic effect on both dechlorination and defluorination processes, with a more pronounced effect on the former. The production of C–OH bonds is inhibited, which facilitates the dechlorination and defluoridation processes.
Methods
This work was carried out in the Dmol3 program in the Material Studio 2017, including the geometric structure optimization and energy calculations. The GGA/PBE method was used in this work, along with the DNP basis, spin-polarized set, and DFT-D correction. The possible TSs were guessed based on the linear synchronous transit/quadratic synchronous transit/conjugate gradient (LST/QST/CG) method, and they were further confirmed and reoptimized to ensure that the only one imaginary frequency exists in the TSs.
