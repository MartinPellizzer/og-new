The study of exoplanet atmospheres is a rapidly growing field in astro-physics, driven by advances in detection technologies and upcoming observations. One of the most promising targets for future research is TRAPPIST-1e, a rocky exoplanet orbiting an M dwarf star within the habitable zone. The planet's unique characteristics make it an ideal candidate for studying atmospheric circulation and composition. This study aims to shed light on the distribution of ozone (O3) in TRAPPIST-1e's atmosphere, exploring how orography affects its circulation and chemical composition.
