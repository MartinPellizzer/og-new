The results showed that the DPMÂ® system was able to produce duckweed biomass with high yields over a prolonged period. The bacterial community profiles revealed significant differences between the two systems, with the ozonated system exhibiting a more diverse and stable community than the non-ozonated system. CFU counts confirmed the effectiveness of aqueous ozone treatment in reducing total bacterial load by 99%. These findings suggest that controlled environment agriculture using vertical towers can be an effective strategy for commercial duckweed production.
