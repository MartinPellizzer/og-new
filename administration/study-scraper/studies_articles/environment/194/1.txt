The authors employed a life cycle assessment approach to evaluate the ecological footprint of the hybrid system, which consisted of wind turbines and PEM electrolyzers. The study used data from various sources, including literature reviews and industrial reports, to estimate the environmental impacts of each component. The impact categories evaluated included climate change, acidification potential, eutrophication potential, and ozone depletion.
