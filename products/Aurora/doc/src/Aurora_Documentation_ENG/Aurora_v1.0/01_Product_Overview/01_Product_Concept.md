## 2. Problem Statement  

### 2.1 Current Challenges in Industrial Sanitization  

Industrial facilities across food processing, pharmaceuticals, healthcare, and logistics face growing pressure to maintain **sterile, contamination-free environments**. However, existing sanitization approaches present several operational challenges:  

#### 2.1.1 **Labor-intensive sanitization methods**  
  Routine sanitization often requires large teams working with chemical products. This increases operating expenses, creates repetitive work risks, and ties up skilled staff on low-value tasks.  

#### 2.1.2 **High downtime and operational disruption**  
  Many sanitization processes require production lines or storage areas to shut down completely, leading to significant productivity losses. Downtime can cost large facilities **tens of thousands of dollars per hour**, making sanitization a hidden but critical financial burden.  

#### 2.1.3 **Inconsistent sanitization effectiveness**  
  Manual methods and chemical applications are prone to variability. Incomplete coverage, uneven chemical distribution, and reliance on human precision often result in **patchy sanitization** that compromises regulatory compliance and product safety.  

---

### 2.2 Risks of Conventional Methods  

Despite widespread use, traditional sanitization methods carry inherent risks that limit their long-term viability:  

#### 2.2.1 **Chemical disinfectants**  
- Leave harmful residues that may contaminate products.  
- Require careful storage, handling, and disposal, raising costs and compliance burdens.  
- Contribute to long-term environmental pollution and chemical dependency.  

#### 2.2.2 **UV sanitization**  
- Highly effective only on **direct line-of-sight surfaces**.  
- Ineffective in shaded areas, on irregular equipment, or inside containers.  
- Degrades plastics and other materials with prolonged exposure.  

#### 2.2.3 **Manual cleaning**  
- High labor cost, particularly in regions with rising wages.  
- Quality depends on operator training, fatigue levels, and consistency.  
- Increased risk of **human error**, leading to hygiene failures and regulatory noncompliance.

### 2.2 Market Demand for Ozone-Based Solutions  

These limitations have created a clear market need for a **safer, more efficient, and automated sanitization technology**. Ozone-based solutions are uniquely positioned to fill this gap, driven by three key factors:  

#### 2.3.1 **Regulatory push toward chemical-free sanitization**  
  Governments and regulatory bodies worldwide are tightening restrictions on chemical disinfectants and mandating safer, eco-friendly alternatives. Ozone, classified as a **GRAS (Generally Recognized as Safe)** agent in many applications, provides a compliant pathway forward.  

#### 2.3.2 **Growing consumer demand for sustainability**  
  Food, pharmaceutical, and healthcare industries face pressure from consumers and investors to reduce environmental impact. Chemical-free sanitization aligns with **ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance)** goals and supports sustainability certifications.  

#### 2.3.3 **Need for reliable, automated, and compliant solutions**  
  Facilities increasingly require **automation-ready sanitization systems** that minimize downtime, reduce labor dependency, and provide digital compliance records. Ozone-based systems can deliver measurable, consistent results while integrating seamlessly into modern smart-factory infrastructures.
