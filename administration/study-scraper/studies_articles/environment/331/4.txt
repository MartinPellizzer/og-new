In conclusion, this study demonstrates the significance of surface modification in improving the interfacial and mechanical properties of carbon fibre-reinforced composites. Ozonation was found to be an effective technique for creating functional groups on the surface of carbon fibres, which improved their bonding with the matrix. The increased ILSS values and tensile strength of the treated carbon fibres suggest that ozone treatment can enhance the overall performance of these composites. These findings have implications for the development of advanced fibre-reinforced materials with improved mechanical properties.
