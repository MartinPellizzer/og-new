The analysis revealed significant improvements in AQ over the study period, with decreases in PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations, as well as reductions in O3, NO2, SO2, and CO levels. The study also found that emissions of ammonia (NH3) and biogenic volatile organic compounds ((B)VOCs) played important roles in affecting AQ. Time series data showed that the implementation of emission reduction policies led to significant decreases in PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations, indicating improved AQ.
