Abstract
Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) drive chemistry in Earth’s atmosphere and play an important role in air pollution management. Globally, vegetation is the largest source of atmospheric VOCs (1). However, regionally, this biogenic input can vary considerably, and with large differences between the contributions of anthropogenic, pyrogenic, and biogenic emissions. The regional apportionment of VOCs therefore remains challenging. On page 1324 of this issue, Pfannerstill et al. (2) report on a wide range of VOC emissions through direct airborne observations over California. They show that up to 60% of the VOC reactivity is associated with biogenic emissions. Their observations also allow VOC emissions to be constrained along transects over southern California, providing a much clearer picture of the anthropogenic and biogenic VOC fluxes. The findings have important implications for air quality regulations aimed at managing ozone and secondary aerosol formation in the South Coast Air Basin region and beyond.
