The performance of the developed ozone DIAL system was evaluated during a field campaign using a tethered balloon platform. The lidar observations showed excellent agreement with those from the balloon platform, demonstrating the system's ability to obtain vertical profiles of lower tropospheric ozone with high spatiotemporal resolutions in the altitude range of 0.3 to 4 km.
