Here is a summary of the study in 1 detailed paragraph, focusing on the information and data related to ozone:

Ozone gas technology is an effective and safe method for treating fresh fruits and vegetables, as it reduces surface microbial load without leaving behind any harmful residues. The final product is breathable oxygen, making it a suitable alternative to traditional methods that use chlorine or fungicide solutions. Research has shown that gaseous ozone treatment induces changes in the physiological activities and quality parameters of fruit and vegetables, leading to improved shelf life and reduced senescence rates. Additionally, the application of ozone gas technology complies with hazard regulations, making it a reliable and sustainable method for ensuring food safety and meeting consumer demands for healthier options.
