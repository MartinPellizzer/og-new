The results showed that surface O3 concentrations increased annually from 2015 to 2019, but declined sharply from 2020 onwards. The HCHO column and NO2 column both increased during this period, indicating a shift towards VOC-limited ozone formation. However, the sharp decline in these columns since 2020 suggests a transition to NOx-limited or transitional regimes. O3 sensitivities were predominantly VOC-limited or transitional regimes in 2019-2021, varying among different mega-city clusters.
