Air quality (AQ) is a critical environmental issue in China, where rapid industrialization and urbanization have led to significant increases in air pollutant emissions. Aerosols and trace gases play important roles in determining AQ, with particles smaller than 2.5 micrometers (PM2.5) or 10 micrometers (PM10) being key indicators of poor air quality. This study aimed to investigate the effects of emission reduction policies on AQ in China using remote sensing data from satellite and ground-based sensors.
