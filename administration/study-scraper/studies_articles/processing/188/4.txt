In conclusion, this study contributes to our understanding of the pathogenic fungi present in wheat and the effects of fumigation on their virulence. The results provide valuable insights into the development of strategies for managing Fusarium infection and mitigating its impact on food security. Further research is needed to explore the optimal application conditions for chlorine dioxide and ozone as well as their efficacy against different Fusarium species.
