Here are the five detailed paragraphs based on the scientific study:

**Paragraph 1**
The world is facing an energy crisis due to the increasing demand for fossil fuels, which account for approximately 80% of global energy consumption. This has led to a pressing need to explore alternative sources of energy. Bioethanol, derived from biomass, is one such potential source that can be produced from waste wood sawdust of Sengon tree (Paraserianthes falcataria). The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of pretreatment with Trichoderma harzianum on the sugar content of hydrolyzed sawdust and to produce bioethanol through fermentation using Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

**Paragraph 2**
The methodology employed in this study involved a combination of pretreatment methods, including enzymatic treatment with T. harzianum and ozone oxidation. The sawdust was first treated with T. harzianum to break down the lignocellulose into simpler sugars. The resulting sugar solution was then subjected to ozone oxidation to further enhance the sugar content. The optimized pretreatment conditions were determined through a series of experiments, and the best treatment method was selected for subsequent fermentation.

**Paragraph 3**
The results showed that the highest sugar yield was obtained from the combination of T. harzianum pretreatment and ozone oxidation, with a sugar content of 0.5 g/g (g glucose per gram dry sawdust). The bioethanol production was also found to be optimal under these conditions, with an ethanol concentration of 0.47 Â± 0.000 g/g after 72 hours of fermentation. These results demonstrate the potential of T. harzianum pretreatment and ozone oxidation in enhancing sugar content and bioethanol production from Sengon sawdust.

**Paragraph 4**
The discussion focuses on the significance of the findings and their implications for future research and industrial applications. The results suggest that the combination of T. harzianum pretreatment and ozone oxidation can be an effective method for improving sugar yield and bioethanol production from Sengon sawdust. This approach has potential applications in the development of sustainable biofuel industries, particularly in areas where biomass is abundant.

**Paragraph 5**
In conclusion, this study demonstrates the feasibility of producing bioethanol from waste wood sawdust of Sengon tree using a combination of T. harzianum pretreatment and ozone oxidation. The results suggest that this approach can be an effective method for improving sugar yield and bioethanol production from Sengon sawdust. Further research is needed to scale up the process and optimize conditions for industrial applications. Nevertheless, the findings of this study contribute significantly to the development of sustainable energy sources and waste management practices.
