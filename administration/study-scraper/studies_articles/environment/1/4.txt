The study concludes that the weekly periodicity of O3 levels in urban and rural sites in Arizona is influenced by seasonal factors. While the methods and seasonal classifications used may not be perfectly aligned with policy-driven analysis choices, the results can guide future study designs aiming to gain confidence in possible regulatory actions to reduce O3 levels. The weekend effect is most pronounced in winter and fall seasons at urban sites, while rural sites do not exhibit this trend. Overall, the study highlights the importance of considering seasonal variations when studying ozone concentrations in arid environments like Arizona.
