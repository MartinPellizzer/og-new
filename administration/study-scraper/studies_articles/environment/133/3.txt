The study highlights the importance of considering soil HONO emissions in strategies for mitigating global air pollution. As anthropogenic emissions decrease, the relative impact of soil HONO emissions on air quality and vegetation is expected to increase. The results also suggest that regional differences in climate change and fertilizer use will have significant effects on soil HONO emissions and their impacts.
