Fusarium infection of wheat is a significant threat to global food security. The fungus can cause scab, mycotoxin contamination, and yield reduction in wheat crops. To understand the impact of Fusarium on wheat, researchers isolated and identified the pathogenic fungi responsible for the infection. This study aimed to identify the Fusarium strains present in wheat and explore the effect of fumigation using ozone and chlorine dioxide on their virulence.
