The results show that ozone levels are contingent on diurnal, day-of-week, and seasonally-dependent factors. The "weekend effect" is most evident in winter and fall seasons, with higher O3 concentrations observed on weekends compared to weekdays at urban sites. Rural sites do not exhibit this weekend effect, showing higher O3 concentrations on Fridays. The study also found that the monsoon summer period has a distinct chemical regime, transitioning from VOC-sensitive to NOx-sensitive.
