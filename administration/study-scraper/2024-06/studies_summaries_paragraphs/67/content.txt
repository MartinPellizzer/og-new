Here is a summary of the study in one detailed paragraph, focusing on the information and data related to ozone (O3):

The study examined associations between exposure to gaseous ambient air pollutants, including ozone (O3), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and nitrogen oxides (NOx), and dementia-related neuroimaging markers among Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study participants. The researchers estimated 10-year mean O3 concentrations at participant addresses using three different exposure estimation methods, including a chemical transport model with observational data fusion (Method 1), national log-normal ordinary kriging (Method 2), and regionalized universal kriging with land-use regression and partial least squares regression (Method 3). The analysis found that point estimates suggested associations between higher exposure to CO, NOx, and NO2 and smaller regional brain volumes, while results for O3 were not statistically significant. However, the study's findings indicate that local variation in estimated air pollution concentrations differs by estimation method, highlighting the importance of considering these differences when evaluating the impact of gaseous pollutants on brain health. Overall, the study suggests that further research is needed to better understand the relationships between gaseous pollutants and cognitive decline, particularly with regard to ozone exposure.
