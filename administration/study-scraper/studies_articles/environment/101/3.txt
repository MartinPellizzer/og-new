The study also evaluated the errors caused by the uncertainty of the wavelength index and found that they are within acceptable limits. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of using a single CO2 Raman cell in the DIAL system, which simplifies the design and reduces costs compared to traditional methods. Furthermore, the system's ability to consider aerosol interference and statistical error enhances its reliability.
