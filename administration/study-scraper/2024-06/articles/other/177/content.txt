Here are five detailed paragraphs summarizing the scientific study:

**Paragraph 1**
Air quality is a significant concern globally due to its impact on human health and the environment. The presence of pollutants in the atmosphere can be influenced by various factors, including weather conditions and atmospheric circulation patterns. This study aimed to investigate the behavior of sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and ozone (O3) concentrations under different synoptic situations in two locations in La Habana, Cuba.

**Paragraph 2**
The study used data from automatic monitoring stations to collect hourly concentrations of SO2, NO2, and O3. The data was then processed to calculate daily mean concentrations in Î¼g/m3 and grouped according to the prevailing synoptic situation. The sampling period was from November 2015 to October 2016. To analyze the relationship between the concentration means and the type of synoptic situation, the Kruskal-Wallis H test was used.

**Paragraph 3**
The results showed that the highest daily mean concentrations were recorded when both locations were under the weak influence of the North Atlantic Subtropical Anticyclone and continental migratory anticyclones. In contrast, the lowest concentrations were observed during periods of strong northwesterly winds. The concentrations of SO2, NO2, and O3 varied significantly depending on the type of synoptic situation.

**Paragraph 4**
The findings suggest that changes in atmospheric circulation patterns can have a significant impact on air quality. During periods of weak anticyclonic influence, pollutants are more likely to accumulate in the atmosphere due to reduced ventilation. In contrast, strong northwesterly winds may help disperse pollutants and improve air quality. These results have important implications for understanding and predicting air pollution episodes.

**Paragraph 5**
In conclusion, this study highlights the importance of considering synoptic situations when assessing and predicting air pollution. The findings provide valuable insights into the relationships between atmospheric circulation patterns and pollutant concentrations, which can inform strategies for improving air quality in urban areas. Further research is needed to understand the impacts of different weather conditions on air quality and to develop effective mitigation measures.
