The study found that SOA composition and yield varied only slightly between GUV222 and O3-only conditions. However, a significant difference was observed in new particle formation under high-fluence 222 nm light (45 ÂµW cm-2), which differed dramatically from ozone-only experiments. This result suggests that the formation of new particles is an important aspect of SOA formation that cannot be explained by ozone chemistry alone.
