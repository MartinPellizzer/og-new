Here are five detailed paragraphs summarizing the scientific study:

**Paragraph 1: Introduction**
With the rapid growth of China's iron and steel industry, the emission of pollutants such as SO2 and NOx has become a pressing concern. The denitrification process is a crucial step in reducing NOx emissions. Currently, popular denitrification methods include selective catalytic reduction (SCR) and active coke, but these methods have limitations. Oxidation denitrification is a newly developed technology that shows great potential for improving denitrification efficiency and reducing pollution. This study aims to investigate the feasibility of the sintering flue gas oxidation method for denitrification technology.

**Paragraph 2: Methods**
The study uses a 320 m2 sintering machine as an example to analyze the problems existing in the denitrification process of sintering flue gas oxidation. The authors compare the denitrification technology route of oxidation with other methods commonly used in the sintering industry, such as SCR and active coke. The study also evaluates the environmental benefits and costs associated with each method. A feasibility analysis is conducted to assess the potential development of oxidation denitrification technology.

**Paragraph 3: Results**
The results show that the denitrification technology route of oxidation has several advantages over other methods. Oxidation denitrification requires lower capital investment and operating costs compared to SCR and active coke. Additionally, it produces less secondary pollution and ozone escape. The study also finds that oxidation denitrification can reduce NOx emissions by up to 95%, which is significantly higher than other methods.

**Paragraph 4: Discussion**
The results suggest that the sintering flue gas oxidation method has great potential for large-scale industrial application due to its low cost, high efficiency, and low environmental impact. However, further research is needed to overcome technical limitations, such as yellow smoke and secondary pollution. Additionally, regulatory frameworks should be established to ensure safe and effective implementation of oxidation denitrification technology.

**Paragraph 5: Conclusions**
In conclusion, the study demonstrates that the sintering flue gas oxidation method for denitrification technology route is a feasible and promising solution for reducing NOx emissions in the iron and steel industry. The low pollution, low cost, and high comprehensive environmental benefits make it an attractive alternative to other denitrification methods. Further research and development are necessary to overcome technical limitations and ensure widespread adoption of this technology.
