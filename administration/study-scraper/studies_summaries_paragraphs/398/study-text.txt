Here is a summary of the study in one detailed paragraph:

The study investigates the reaction networks of Criegee intermediates formed in ozone-assisted oxidation reactions of two alkenes, trans-2-pentene and cyclopentene, between 320 K to 760 K. Using molecular-beam mass spectrometry and single photon tunable synchrotron VUV radiation, elusive intermediates were identified through experimental photoionization energy scans and ab initio threshold energy calculations for isomer identification. The results show that Criegee intermediates formed in the ozonolysis of trans-2-pentene react bimolecularly with aldehydes to form high molecular weight products, whereas those formed in the ozone assisted oxidation of cyclopentene decompose primarily. Additionally, threshold ionization energy calculations suggest detection of ketohydroperoxide intermediates in both reactions. This study provides new mechanistic insights into ozone-assisted oxidation reactions of two alkenes with different structures, which is critical for developing improved kinetics models.
