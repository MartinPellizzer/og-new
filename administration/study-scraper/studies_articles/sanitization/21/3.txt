The findings suggest that the robot germicidal system is an effective tool for maintaining public health while promoting sustainable development. The system's autonomous mode and remote control capabilities make it a valuable asset in various settings, such as hospitals, schools, and public transportation systems. Furthermore, the system's ability to turn off automatically after disinfection reduces the risk of environmental contamination.
