Here is a summary of the study in one paragraph, focusing on the information and data related to ozone:

The study characterizes the tropical tropopause parameters over Chennai (13.0° N, 80.06° E) in the northeast monsoon region using radiosonde observations during 2014-2019. The results show that the cold point tropopause (CPT) height and temperature vary seasonally, with higher values (17.6 km and 189.7 K) during winter and lower values (16.6 km and 192.1 K) during summer monsoon seasons. The ozone mixing ratio at CPT is found to be lower (~3.1 ppmv) during winter and higher (4.8 ppmv) during summer monsoon seasons, with a mean value of 3.9 ppmv over the study period. These variations are associated with changes in water vapor and temperature anomalies in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. The study also categorizes tropical convections as non-penetrative and penetrative using Infrared brightness temperature (IRBT) data, and finds that the TTL temperature warms with increasing strength of non-penetrative convections and cools for penetrative convection.
