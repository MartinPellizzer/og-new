Here is a summary of the study in one paragraph, focusing on the information and data related to ozone:

This study uses the Energy Exascale Earth System Model version 2 (E3SMv2) with linearized stratospheric ozone chemistry to separate the temperature-driven changes from transport impacts on stratospheric ozone. The model produces a natural quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) cycle in winds, temperature, and ozone for the period 1979-2020, allowing the analysis of climatological QBO patterns of ozone. Results show that ozone perturbations above 20-hPa are predicted by the steady-state response of the ozone column to temperature changes, while those below 20-hPa are driven by circulation changes. This demarcation is crucial for understanding model-model differences in the QBO-ozone responses and diagnosing climate projections.
