Abstract
The removal of persistent organic micropollutants (OMPs) from secondary effluent in wastewater treatment plants is critical for meeting water reuse standards. Traditional treatment methods often fail to adequately degrade these contaminants. This study explored the efficacy of a hybrid ozonation membrane filtration (HOMF) process using CeO2 and CeTiOx-doped ceramic crossflow ultrafiltration ceramic membranes for the degradation of OMPs. Hollow ceramic membranes (CM) with a 300 kDa molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) were modified to serve as substrates for catalytic nanosized metal oxides in a crossflow and inside-out operational configuration. Three types of depositions were tested: a single layer of CeO2, a single layer of CeTiOx, and a combined layer of CeO2 + CeTiOx. These catalytic nanoparticles were distributed uniformly using a solution-based method supported by vacuum infiltration to ensure high-throughput deposition. The results demonstrated successful infiltration of the metal oxides, although the yield permeability and transmembrane flow varied, following this order: pristine > CeTiOx > CeO2 > CeO2 + CeTiOx. Four OMPs were examined: two easily degraded by ozone (carbamazepine and diclofenac) and two recalcitrant (ibuprofen and pCBA). The highest OMP degradation was observed in demineralized water, particularly with the CeO2 + CeTiOx modification, suggesting O3 decomposition to hydroxyl radicals. The increased resistance in the modified membranes contributed to the adsorption phenomena. The degradation efficiency decreased in secondary effluent due to competition with the organic and inorganic load, highlighting the challenges in complex water matrices.

1. Introduction
Urbanization and industrialization have led to the generation of vast quantities of wastewater containing diverse organic micropollutants (OMPs), including pharmaceuticals and personal care products, which pose significant challenges to traditional treatment methods [1,2]. The need for effective wastewater treatment is further underscored by the growing water scarcity intensified by climate change and erratic rainfall patterns. In response to these challenges, the concept of water reuse (also known as water recycling or water reclamation) has gained prominence as a sustainable solution to augment declining freshwater resources [3]. By treating wastewater to a high standard, it can be safely reused for various non-potable applications, such as irrigation, industrial processes, and environmental restoration.
Water reuse not only helps alleviate the strain on freshwater sources but also contributes to the circular economy by conserving resources and minimizing waste generation. In regions facing water scarcity, such as southern parts of Europe (Spain, Cyprus, Italy, and Greece), water reuse has become integral to ensuring water security and resilience in the face of climate variability (WFD 2000/60/EC [4], EU 2020/2184 [5]). Moreover, by diverting treated wastewater from discharge into water bodies, water reuse helps mitigate pollution and protects aquatic ecosystems from the adverse impacts of OMPs and other contaminants.
In light of these considerations, the European Union (EU) has implemented directives and regulations to promote water reuse and establish quality standards for recycled water [4,6]. These directives aim to facilitate the safe and sustainable reuse of treated wastewater for agricultural, industrial, and urban applications while safeguarding human health and the environment. By setting stringent criteria for water quality and treatment processes, the EU directives ensure that recycled water meets the required standards for its intended use, thereby promoting public acceptance and confidence in water reuse practices.
In response to these challenges, researchers have been exploring innovative treatment approaches to efficiently remove OMPs from wastewater. Hybrid treatment processes, which combine multiple technologies to synergistically target different classes of pollutants, have emerged as promising solutions [7,8]. Among these hybrid approaches, ozonation combined with membrane filtration has gained traction due to its versatility and effectiveness in removing a wide range of contaminants. Ozone (O3) is a powerful oxidizing agent that can react with organic compounds present in wastewater, leading to their degradation into simpler, less harmful by-products [9,10,11]. When coupled with membrane filtration, which physically separates suspended solids and microorganisms, ozonation offers a comprehensive treatment solution for complex wastewater streams [12,13].
While membrane filtration has been widely adopted in wastewater treatment plants, the choice of membrane material significantly influences the treatment efficiency and longevity [14,15,16]. Traditional polymeric membranes, although cost-effective, are prone to fouling, chemical degradation, and a limited lifespan under harsh operating conditions [17]. In contrast, ceramic membranes have garnered attention for their superior chemical and mechanical stability, resistance to fouling, and longer service life [18]. Composed of inorganic materials such as alumina, zirconia, or titania, ceramic membranes (CMs) exhibit enhanced durability and reliability in wastewater treatment applications, making them well-suited for challenging environments [19,20,21,22].
A number of recent studies have investigated heterogeneous catalytic ozonation coupled with membrane filtration in an attempt to achieve better removal of OMPs and their transformation products, supporting a reduction in toxicity after treatment [23,24,25,26]. So far, researchers have proposed the following modifications to enhance OMPs reduction: MnO2-Co3O4 [27], MnO2 [28], Ce-Ti composites [29], ZnO2 [30], CeOx and MnOx [31], and Co3O4-Al2O3 [32], supporting a reduction in toxicity after treatment. In all of them, hydroxyl radical (•OH) exposure was drastically increased; however, fouling was a problem. Therefore, efficient coupling of ozone to CM, adjusting the ozone dosage and the catalytic material used, is needed to prevent severe membrane fouling. In very recent studies (2024), He et al. [33] investigated the effect of Fe(II)/KMnO4 on the fouling of ceramic membranes and found that ozonation mitigates fouling caused by humic acid as it is decomposed into reactive radicals. Additionally, Liangby et al. [34] used Fe3O4-modified ceramic membranes during ozonation, and fouling by humic acids was also reduced during atrazine treatment.
Different methods exist for applying thin film layers of metal oxides to other materials. Common methods include Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD), Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD), Sol-Gel Processing, and Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD). PVD techniques like sputtering and evaporation transfer material from a source to a substrate in a vacuum, resulting in high-purity films with excellent adhesion and controlled thickness [35]. CVD involves the chemical reactions of gaseous precursors on a heated substrate, forming a solid film with excellent conformality and uniformity over complex geometries, making it ideal for high-quality films of various materials [36]. Sol-gel processing involves hydrolysis and condensation of metal alkoxides to form a colloidal suspension (sol) that transitions into a gel and then a thin film upon drying and heating, producing high homogeneity and purity films at a lower cost [37]. ALD is a sequential, self-limiting process that deposits films one atomic layer at a time. It provides precise control over the thickness and composition, offering excellent uniformity and conformality at the atomic scale, making it ideal for ultrathin films. For instance, Liu and He [38] applied ALD to create an ultra-thin layer of Al2O3 on a membrane with great potential for industrial H2 purification and recovery.
In this study, a novel approach that integrates catalytic ozonation with crossflow ultrafiltration using tubular ceramic membranes doped with metal oxides with a vacuum infiltration technique is proposed. Specifically, the deposition of cerium oxide (CeO2), cerium-doped titanium oxide (CeTiOx), and their combination onto ceramic substrates to enhance the catalytic activity during ozonation [31,39] is investigated. The choice of these metal oxides is motivated by their known catalytic properties, which can potentially accelerate the degradation of pharmaceuticals and other recalcitrant micropollutants. Herein, the degradation of carbamazepine (CBZ), diclofenac (DCF), ibuprofen (IBP), and para-chlorobenzoic acid (pCBA) in the presence or absence of a scavenger, such as tertiary butanol (TBA), and in real secondary effluent from the Girona’s wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) is tested.
The hypothesis guiding our research is that modifying ceramic membranes with CeO2, CeTiOx, or their combination will enhance the degradation of recalcitrant OMPs, such as IBP and pCBA, during ozonation. By leveraging the catalytic activity of these metal oxides, we aim to achieve improved pollutant removal efficiency and overall treatment performance. Through systematic experimentation and analysis, we seek to validate this hypothesis and contribute to the advancement of hybrid ozonation–membrane filtration systems for urban wastewater treatment.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Chemicals and Materials
In this study, carbamazepine (CBZ), ibuprofen (IBP), and diclofenac (DCF) were used as model pharmaceutical compounds because they are frequently detected in secondary effluents. CBZ (99.8%, C15H12N2O), IBP (98.9%, C13H18O2), and DCF sodium salt (98%, C14H10C12NNaO2) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Para-chlorobenzoic acid (pCBA, 99%, C7H5ClO2) was used as an O3/•OH probe compound, and it was purchased from ACROS Organics (Waltham, MA, USA). The physicochemical characteristics of the model compounds are summarized in Table S1. Sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) was used as a buffer to avoid variations in the pH, and it was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. For the filtration experiments, single-tubular commercial ceramic membranes (CM) with 10 mm outer diameter, 6 mm inner diameter, 250 mm length, and 300 kDa molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) were utilized (INSIDECéRAM, TAMI Industries, Nyons, France). Table S2 summarizes the characteristics of the CMs. For the modification of the CMs, the following chemicals were used: titanium (IV) isopropoxide (TIP, 97%, C12H28O4Ti, Sigma-Aldrich), cerium (III) nitrate hexahydrate (ceria, 99.5%, CeN3O9·6H2O, ACROS Organics), citric acid (C6H8O7, Sigma-Aldrich), nitric acid (HNO3, Sigma Aldrich) isopropanol (IPA, C3H8O, Grammol, Zagreb, Croatia, HR), acetylacetone (AcAc, ≥99%, C5H8O2, Honeywell, Charlotte, NC, USA) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA, (C2H4O)x). In all the ozonation experiments, thiosulfate (Na2S2O3, Sigma Aldrich) was used to quench the reaction. For the scavenging tests, tertiary butanol (TBA, C4H10O, Sigma Aldrich) was used as a scavenger of hydroxyl radicals (•OH). The mobile phase of the liquid chromatography was prepared with ultrapure water (Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany), acetonitrile (ACN, CH3CN, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), and formic acid (FA, CH2O2, Sigma-Aldrich).
2.2. Preparation of Modified Ceramic Membranes
The CMs were modified by the sol-gel method under vacuum infiltration conditions to allow good sol dispersion (colloidal solution) through the membrane’s pores and surface. Two different sols were prepared, ceria (CeO2) and Ce-doped Ti (CeTiOx) with 1% mol Ce with regards to Ti [39]. Three nanosized films were separately deposited on the surface of each CM: one layer of CeO2 [31], one layer of CeTiOx (TiO2 [40] adjusted to [39]), and one layer of CeO2 with an additional layer of CeTiOx (CeO2 + CeTiOx). The sol-gel-assisted wet infiltration method was used for the modification of the CMs. The ceria precursor solution consisted of 0.5 M cerium (III) nitrate and 1.0 M citric acid in ultrapure water and was prepared and stirred overnight to achieve colloidal properties. The titania precursor solution containing 1% mol Ce in regard to Ti was prepared by dissolving 1.41 g cerium (III) nitrate in 1:10:10 v/v 0.5 M HNO3:IPA:TIP solution by adding AcAc and IPA. The calculations were adjusted from Ćurković et al. [40]. A step-by-step procedure is described in the Supplementary Materials (Text S1).
2.3. Characterization Techniques
The pristine ceramic membranes and their modified surfaces were characterized to determine their chemical and phase composition, structure, and morphology using the following analytical techniques: Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) with Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray Diffraction Analysis (XRD), and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). Mercury intrusion porosimeter (MIP) was used to evaluate the porosity, pore size distribution, and pore volume.
The morphology of the CMs was characterized using
