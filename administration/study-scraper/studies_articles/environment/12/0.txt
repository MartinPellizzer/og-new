Nitrous oxide (N2O) decomposition is a crucial strategy to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and address ozone depletion. The United Nations' sustainable development goals (SDGs) and carbon neutrality objectives align with the urgent need for effective N2O treatment technologies. Despite recent advancements, a comprehensive review of N2O reduction catalysts and pathways has been lacking. This study aims to provide a thorough evaluation of N2O treatment technologies from a holistic perspective, exploring novel approaches and mechanisms.
