Here are five detailed paragraphs based on the study:

**Paragraph 1**
Ozone therapy has been increasingly used in various fields of medicine and dentistry to promote healing and reduce inflammation. At low concentrations, ozone acts as a powerful oxidant with antimicrobial activity and the ability to promote healing processes. Its therapeutic benefits have been reported in the treatment of several diseases, including dental caries, periodontal diseases, and oral ulcers. However, some adverse effects and contraindications must be considered, primarily related to toxicity from inhalation and systemic administration.

**Paragraph 2**
The present review aimed to provide an overview of the biological mechanisms involved in ozone interaction with dental tissues. A literature search was performed using combined terms related to ozone and possible biological effects, including PubMed/MEDLINE database. Key references were selected based on their relevance to ozone-related biological mechanisms in oral tissues, including in vitro studies, animal and human studies.

**Paragraph 3**
The results of the present review indicated that ozone exhibited antimicrobial activity through oxidation, which caused dysfunction of bacterial cell walls and cytoplasmic membranes. Additionally, ozone induced mild oxidative stress, triggering antioxidant responses and anti-inflammatory mechanisms. Ozone also demonstrated immunomodulatory effects, stimulating T-cell mediated immunity. Furthermore, ozonized products showed remineralizing properties, promoting enamel and dentine hardness.

**Paragraph 4**
The discussion of the present review highlighted the potential benefits of ozone therapy in dentistry, including its antimicrobial activity against oral bacteria and fungi, remineralization of dental tissues, immunomodulation, and biostimulation. The results also emphasized the need for further research to fully understand the mechanisms involved in ozone interaction with dental tissues.

**Paragraph 5**
In conclusion, the present review provided an overview of the biological mechanisms involved in ozone interaction with dental tissues. Ozone therapy has been reported to have antimicrobial activity, promote remineralization, and exhibit immunomodulatory effects. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms involved in ozone interaction with dental tissues and to optimize its use in dentistry.
