    "abstract": "In the past decade, the plant-based meat alternative industry has grown rapidly due to consumers' demand for environmental-friendly, nutritious, sustainable and humane choices. Consumers are not only concerned about the positive relationship between food consumption and health, they are also keen on the environmental sustainability. With such increased consumers' demand for meat alternatives, there is an urgent need for identification and modification of protein sources to imitate the functionality, textural, organoleptic and nutritional characteristics of traditional meat products. However, the plant proteins are not readily digestible and require more functionalization and modification are required. Proteins has to be modified to achieve high quality attributes such as solubility, gelling, emulsifying and foaming properties to make them more palatable and digestible. The protein source from the plant source in order to achieve the claims which needs more high protein digestibility and amino acid bioavailability. In order to achieve these newer emerging non-thermal technologies which can operate under mild temperature conditions can reach a balance between feasibility and reduced environmental impact maintaining the nutritional attributes and functional attributes of the proteins. This review article has discussed the mechanism of protein modification and advancements in the application of non-thermal technologies such as high pressure processing and pulsed electric field and emerging oxidation technologies (ultrasound, cold plasma, and ozone) on the structural modification of plant-based meat alternatives to improve, the techno-functional properties and palatability for successful food product development applications."
