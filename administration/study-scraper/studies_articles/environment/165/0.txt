Air pollution and climate change have been increasingly recognized as major threats to public health. Understanding the impact of these factors on mortality is crucial for effective healthcare planning and management. The Po Valley in Italy, one of the most polluted areas in Europe, provides an ideal case study for exploring the effects of air pollution and climate change on all-cause mortality. This study aims to quantify the association between ozone concentration and total mortality using a novel model based on Functional Data Analysis (FDA).
