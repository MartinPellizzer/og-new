In recent years, there has been a significant shift towards a healthier lifestyle, with consumers increasingly incorporating fresh fruits and vegetables into their diets. However, the rapid growth rate of fresh produce makes it prone to microbial infections and senescence. Traditional methods of preserving freshness, such as dipping in chlorine or fungicide solutions, have raised concerns about chemical residues. In response, researchers have turned to alternative technologies like ozone gas treatment, which has been shown to reduce surface microbial load while inducing physiological changes in fruit and vegetables.
