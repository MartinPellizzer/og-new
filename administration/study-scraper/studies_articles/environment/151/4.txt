In conclusion, this study demonstrates the usefulness of POCP as a method for quantifying the ozone-forming potential of VOCs. The findings suggest that certain VOCs are potent ozone formers and should be prioritized for control measures. Furthermore, the study highlights the importance of continued research into the chemical processes involved in O3 formation, with the ultimate goal of developing effective strategies to mitigate its adverse impacts on human health and the environment.
