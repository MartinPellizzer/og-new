The Earth's stratosphere is a crucial layer of the atmosphere that plays a vital role in regulating temperature and protecting life on Earth. The total column ozone (TCO) is an important parameter that measures the amount of ozone in the stratosphere. A recent study by Newman et al. (2024) has reported record high March 2024 Arctic TCO, which has significant implications for our understanding of the atmospheric circulation patterns and climate dynamics.
