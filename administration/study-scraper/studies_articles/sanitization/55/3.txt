The findings suggest that the surface reaction between ozone and oxygen atoms is a key mechanism in ozone destruction. By controlling the surface condition, it may be possible to manipulate the rate constant and develop strategies for mitigating ozone destruction. Further research is needed to fully understand the reaction mechanisms involved and to explore potential applications.
