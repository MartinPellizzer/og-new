The system for reducing the microbiological load consists of a spiral conveyor enabling a continuous process of ozonation and UV-C radiation. Ozone gas is supplied to the chamber through nozzles, while ozone is generated by a set of Korona L 400 TOWER generators with a capacity of 240 g hâˆ’1. The chamber is equipped with an inlet and outlet for fruit transportation, as well as UV-C ultraviolet radiation sources positioned at the inlet and outlet for the fruits.
