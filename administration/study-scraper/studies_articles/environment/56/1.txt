The study employed a time-series analysis design to examine the relationship between PM2.5, O3, and mortality in China. Mortality data were obtained from national health surveillance systems, while high-resolution pollutant predictions were generated using a hybrid model combining meteorological data and land use information. Generalized additive models were used to estimate the associations of PM2.5 and O3 with mortality, while modification and interaction effects were explored through stratified analyses and synergistic indexes.
