Here is a summary of the study in 1 detailed paragraph:

Over the last 30 years, Taiwan has implemented environmental policies and countermeasures to phase out ozone-depleting substances (ODS), including chlorofluorocarbons (CFC), hydrochloro-fluorocarbons (HCFC), carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), halon, and methyl chloroform (CH3CCl3). As a result, the phase-out of some ODS was achieved prior to 2010. However, HFC emissions showed a V-type variation, increasing from 663 kilotons of CO2eq in 1993 to 2,330 kilotons of CO2eq in 2001 and then decreasing to 373 kilotons of CO2eq in 2011, before rising again to 1,555 kilotons of CO2eq in 2022. To comply with the Kigali Amendment (KA-2015), Taiwan has taken regulatory actions to reduce the consumption of some HFC substances with high global warming potential (GWP) by 80% by 2045.
