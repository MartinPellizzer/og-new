The study found that ozone has a dual nature, playing a crucial role in protecting life on Earth by absorbing harmful UV radiation in the stratosphere while simultaneously being a potent greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change when present at higher altitudes. Additionally, tropospheric ozone was found to be a significant air pollutant, posing health risks to humans and animals.
