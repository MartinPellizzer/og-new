Here is a summary of the study in one paragraph, focusing on the information related to ozone:

The study investigates the potential benefits of medical ozone therapy in preventing compromised nasal skin in revision rhinoplasty patients. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 523 revision rhinoplasty patients who received either ozone therapy or not. Results show that ozone therapy recipients had significantly fewer skin problems (p<0.05) compared to those without ozone therapy, suggesting a potentially safe and effective treatment option for patients undergoing revision rhinoplasty, particularly those with compromised nasal skin. The study also highlights the potential mechanisms by which ozone therapy may promote skin healing and regeneration, including enhanced oxygen delivery and modulation of the immune response. Overall, these findings suggest that ozone therapy may be a valuable adjunct treatment for managing skin complications in revision rhinoplasty patients.
