The discussion surrounding these results highlights the importance of considering bushfire aerosols in models of stratospheric chemistry and PSC dynamics. The enhanced HNO3 concentrations and subsequent PSC formation may have significant implications for ozone depletion and global climate change. Furthermore, as tropospheric warming is expected to increase the frequency of extreme wildfire events and stratospheric cooling expands PSC areal coverage, these findings contribute significantly to our understanding of the impacts of extreme wildfire events on stratospheric chemistry.
