The study's findings have important implications for policymakers and businesses in India. The results suggest that reducing air pollution can lead to significant improvements in labor productivity, which in turn can benefit both workers and employers. Moreover, the study highlights the need for a comprehensive approach to addressing air pollution, rather than focusing solely on PM2.5. The researchers illustrate this point by analyzing the potential productivity impacts of a national policy in India that targets PM2.5 compared to a counterfactual policy that also targets carbon monoxide and ozone.
