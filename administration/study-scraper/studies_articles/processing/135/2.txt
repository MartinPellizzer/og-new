The results showed that there was a significant agreement between the experimental data on COD removal and the predicted values obtained from the CCD method. The Pareto analysis revealed that the reaction time, catalyst amount, and initial ozone concentration had the most significant effects on COD removal, accounting for 35.58%, 34.64%, and 10.87% of the variance, respectively.
