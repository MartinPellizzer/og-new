These findings suggest that Lhasa's ozone pollution is more complex and sensitive than previously thought, likely driven by the interplay between atmospheric oxidant capacity, precursor emissions, and environmental factors. The study highlights the importance of considering these interactions when developing control strategies for O3 pollution in high-altitude cities like Lhasa.
