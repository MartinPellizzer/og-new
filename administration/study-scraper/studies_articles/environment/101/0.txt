Tropospheric ozone sensing is a crucial task in atmospheric science, as it plays a significant role in determining air quality and climate change. However, traditional methods of measuring ozone concentrations have limitations, such as low spatial and temporal resolutions. To address this challenge, researchers have been developing innovative technologies, including differential absorption lidar (DIAL) systems. This study presents the development and performance evaluation of an ozone DIAL system based on a single CO2 Raman cell.
