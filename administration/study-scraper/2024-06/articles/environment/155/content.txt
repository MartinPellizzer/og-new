**Paragraph 1**
Nanocluster aerosols (NCAs) are a type of airborne nanoparticle that is less than 3 nanometers in diameter. They have been linked to climate feedbacks and potential human health effects, making their study important for understanding indoor air quality and human exposure. Our recent research has shown that NCAs can be formed through the reaction of ozone with human surfaces, but the underlying mechanisms driving this process are still not fully understood.

**Paragraph 2**
In order to investigate the formation of NCAs, we designed an experiment in which we painted squalene and 6-hexadecenoic acid (C16:1n6) on glass plates and exposed them to ozone in a climate-controlled chamber. We measured the NCAs generated from these reactions using a Nano Condensation Nucleus Counter (Airmodus A11 nCNC System). The experiment was designed to investigate the influence of ozone and ammonia levels on NCA formation.

**Paragraph 3**
Our results show that the reaction of squalene with ozone generates significantly more NCAs than the reaction of C16:1n6 with ozone. In fact, the steady-state NCA level during the squalene-ozone reaction was 40 times higher than during the C16:1n6-ozone reaction. The size distributions of NCAs also differed between the two reactions, with the squalene-ozone reaction generating a higher concentration of small NCAs (1.2-1.5 nm).

**Paragraph 4**
The results suggest that squalene plays a dominant role in NCA formation when ozone reacts with human skin lipids. This is likely due to the presence of multiple unsaturated C‚ïêC bonds in squalene, which can lead to the formation of low-volatility compounds that may nucleate and form NCAs. The influence of ozone level on NCA formation was also investigated, and we found that increasing ozone levels resulted in higher NCA emissions. However, increasing ammonia levels had a complex effect, resulting in both larger and smaller NCAs.

**Paragraph 5**
In conclusion, our study demonstrates the importance of squalene-ozone reactions in forming NCAs. The results have implications for understanding indoor air quality and human exposure to NCAs, which are known to penetrate deep into the lungs and potentially reach the brain. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms driving NCA formation and to develop effective strategies for reducing NCA emissions indoors.
