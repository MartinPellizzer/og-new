Abstract
UV-ozone (UV-O3) exposure and Focused ion beam (FIB) has shown great potential in material/surface modification and defect engineering in 2D materials more recently, especially within the transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) family, with the aim to tailor their optical and electronic properties. A better understanding and control of defects is important to move forward in the field of defect engineering in TMDCs. In this study, we investigated the effect of UV-O3 exposure on the optical and electrical properties of the suspended and flat 2D TMDCs.
