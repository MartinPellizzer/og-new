The research team used a combination of methods to isolate and identify the Fusarium strains. They collected wheat samples from various regions and extracted the fungal species using a series of dilutions and culturing techniques. The isolated fungi were then identified based on morphological characteristics, such as spore morphology and mycelium length. Additionally, toxin-producing gene detection and mycotoxin detection methods were used to analyze the production of zearalenone, vomitoxin, and fumonisin by each strain.
