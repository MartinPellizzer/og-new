Abstract
6 PPD-Q (6 PPD-Quinone) is an ozone-induced byproduct derived from the degradation of N-(1,3-dimethylbutyl)-N′-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine (6 PPD), commonly found in road dust resulting from tire wear. However, the extent of 6 PPD-Q pollution in urban soil remains unclear. This study investigates the spatial and temporal accumulation patterns of 6 PPD-Q in greenbelt soils in Ningbo, and explores the correlation between 6 PPD-Q accumulation and soil microbial community composition and functions. Our findings indicate that 6 PPD-Q is present (ranging from 0.85 to 12.58 μg/kg) in soil samples collected from both sides of urban traffic arteries. Soil fungi exhibit higher sensitivity to 6 PPD-Q accumulation compared to bacteria, and associated fungi (Basidiomycota) may be potential biomarkers for environmental 6 PPD-Q contamination. Co-occurrence network analysis reveals that the bacterial microbial network in summer exhibits greater stability and resilience in response to 6 PPD-Q inputs than in winter. However, 6 PPD-Q accumulation disrupts the network structure of fungal communities to some extent, leading to reduced diversity in fungal microbial communities. Long-term accumulation of 6 PPD-Q weakens the nitrogen and phosphorus cycling potential within urban soil, while the enhancement of carbon cycling may further promote 6 PPD-Q degradation in urban soil. Taken together, this study provides new insights into the ecological risks of 6 PPD-Q in urban soils.

Introduction
Tire wear particles (TWPs) serve as a unique source of microplastics and have been detected in various environmental matrices (Kole et al., 2017; Wagner et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2023). To enhance the quality, performance and extend the service life of tires, rubber antioxidants are incorporated to enhance resistance during the tire production process (Huntink et al., 2004). Among them, N-(1,3-dimethylbutyl)-N′-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine (6 PPD) is widely used to safeguard tires against damage and wear caused by ozone reactions (Hu et al., 2022). During the aging and decomposition process of TWPs, 6 PPD reacts with ozone to leach a new ozone converting agent known as N-(1,3-dimethylbutyl)-N′-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine quinone (6 PPD-Q), which is globally distributed through atmospheric transport (Klauschies and Isanta-Navarro, 2022) and surface runoff (Li et al., 2023). Recent studies have reported that municipal stormwater containing 6 PPD-Q caused large-scale acute mortality of coho salmon when they migrate to urban freshwater streams to reproduce (Tian et al., 2021). Subsequent research has confirmed the presence of both 6 PPD and 6 PPD-Q in fish samples for the first time (Ji et al., 2022; Tian et al., 2022), raising concerns regarding the environmental levels and health risks of 6 PPD-Q (Kazmi et al., 2024).
As an emerging pollutant, a growing body of research has revealed the widespread presence of 6 PPD-Q in various environmental compartments, including road dust (Deng et al., 2022), atmospheric particles (Klöckner et al., 2021a), surface runoff (Challis et al., 2021), sediments (Klöckner et al., 2021b), oceans (Zeng et al., 2023), food (Ji et al., 2022), and even human urine (Du et al., 2022; Ihenetu et al., 2024). Notably, road dust serves as a key reservoir for 6 PPD-Q, which can readily enter surface runoff during hydrological events, posing a threat to aquatic organisms (Ricarte et al., 2023). Recent research by Huang and colleagues examined dust particles in various settings, including roadsides, parking lots, car interiors, and indoor living rooms, revealing significantly higher median concentrations of 6 PPD and 6 PPD-Q in outdoor road dust compared to indoor living room dust (Huang et al., 2021). Additionally, a separate study observed elevated levels of 6 PPD-Q in dust samples collected from high-traffic arterial roads in contrast to residential roads (Hiki and Yamamoto, 2022). Multiple PPD-like compounds and their corresponding quinone conversion products have been identified across various environmental media, with 6 PPD-Q being detected as frequently as 100% in runoff water, air particles, and roadside soil, with the highest recorded concentration of 234 ng/g in roadside soil samples (Cao et al., 2022). These findings underscore the significance of transport-related sources in the distribution of both 6 PPD and 6 PPD-Q. Therefore, a comprehensive investigation into the contamination characteristics of 6 PPD-Q in road dust is imperative.
In the course of urban traffic development, the continuous wear and tear of vehicle tires lead to the release of tire particles into the surrounding soil. Among these particles, 6 PPD-Q gradually accumulates in the surface soil along roadways as tire particles age (Chen et al., 2023). Research has elucidated that the presence of 6 PPD-Q has profound effects on both soil and the gut microbes of collembolan organisms, subsequently influencing the carbon and nitrogen cycles within soil ecosystems and resulting in consequential alterations to overall soil ecosystem functionality (Xu et al., 2023a). It's well-established that soil microorganisms can be significantly impacted by external organic contaminants. In such cases, certain microbes with the capacity to thrive and metabolize these organic compounds as carbon sources or exhibit a high resistance to them can accumulate over time, becoming dominant microorganisms. Conversely, some more delicate microorganisms struggle to thrive and metabolize in the presence of these pollutants, leading to a notable reduction in microbial diversity and, in turn, detrimentally impacting the ecological equilibrium (Shahi et al., 2017). Given these dynamics, monitoring shifts in soil ecology through extensive surveys assumes paramount importance. Such surveys are instrumental in gaining a deeper understanding of the potential ecological repercussions of 6 PPD-Q within urban soil environments.
This study analyzed soil samples collected from greenbelt surface soils with different traffic densities in the urban, suburban and rural areas of Ningbo in order to: (i) clarify the spatio-temporal variation characteristics of 6 PPD-Q content in soils with different traffic densities alongside urbanization gradient, and (ii) analyze the simultaneous variation of microbial community structure in soils. We hypothesized that the accumulation of 6 PPD-Q varies significantly with urbanization gradients and could further influence the microbial communities as well as element cycling in urban soils. Building upon these findings, we aimed to establish a correlation between the accumulation of 6 PPD-Q in the soil and changes in the abundance of distinctive microbial species. Additionally, we delved into the disparities in the abundance of functional genes associated with carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur nutrient cycling within urban soil, utilizing gene chip technology as a tool. Combined with 6 PPD-Q content in soil, the potential effects of accumulation of 6 PPD-Q under long-term TWPs on biogenic element cycling in urban soil were revealed.

Study area and sampling
In this study, we collected soil samples from areas with varying traffic densities in Ningbo city, encompassing urban, peri-urban, and rural locales. The sampling depth for soil samples is the topsoil layer of 0–10 cm, and the sampling points are all within 2 m from both sides of the road. The specific sampling sites are delineated in Fig. S1. To provide a comprehensive representation of the urbanization gradient, our sampling sites were strategically positioned along the spectrum, comprising
Temporal and spatial accumulation characteristics of 6 PPD-Q
The distribution characteristics of 6 PPD-Q in samples from different regions are different. The presence of 6 PPD-Q was detected in soil environment samples on both sides of traffic arteries except in farmland soil far from traffic flow, indicating that 6 PPD-Q has become one of the characteristic pollutants in urban soil (Fig. 1). The 6 PPD-Q content of most sites was less than 10 μg/kg, except for 5 sites with higher 6 PPD-Q concentrations where the detected concentration of 6 PPD-Q at the
Conclusion
This study investigated the 6 PPD-Q contamination in urban soils surrounding traffic arteries within Ningbo city, China, and identified the spatio-temporal responses of soil bacterial and fungal communities to 6 PPD-Q accumulation. We found that the accumulation of 6 PPD-Q in winter was generally higher than that in summer, with hotspot areas for high 6 PPD-Q content predominantly located at high-speed intersections, traffic-heavy road junctions, and congestion-prone routes. Notably, the
