Here are five detailed paragraphs based on the scientific study:

**Paragraph 1**
Atmospheric pressure plasma jets (APPJs) have been widely used in various applications due to their ability to produce reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS). In this study, the productions of RONS with duty ratio in atmospheric pressure plasma jets were investigated. The researchers aimed to explore the effects of duty ratio on the production of NO, NO2, N2O, and O3 in the APPJ.

**Paragraph 2**
The experiments used a sinusoidal voltage bunch with an on-time duration and an off-time duration without any voltage bunch for plasma jet operation. The duty ratio was varied from 10% to 80%, and the reactive species were measured using gas-FTIR and ozone meter. The rotational temperature was also measured as a function of on-time duration.

**Paragraph 3**
The results showed that all reactive species exhibited increased production with increasing duty ratio. However, under a fixed duty-ratio of 10%, the production of NO enhanced by 1.5 times, while the production of other species decreased with increasing on-time duration. The measured rotational temperature also varied with on-time duration.

**Paragraph 4**
The results indicate that the production of RONS in APPJs is highly dependent on the duty ratio and on-time duration. The enhancement of NO production under a fixed duty-ratio may be attributed to the higher rotational temperature at longer on-time durations. The decrease in production of other species may be due to the competition for reactive intermediates.

**Paragraph 5**
In conclusion, this study demonstrates the importance of considering the duty ratio and on-time duration when designing APPJs for specific applications. The findings provide valuable insights into the optimization of APPJ operation parameters for maximum RONS production. Further research is needed to explore the effects of duty ratio on RONS production in different gas compositions and plasma configurations.
