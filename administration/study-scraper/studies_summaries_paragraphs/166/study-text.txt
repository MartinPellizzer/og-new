Here is a summary of the study in 1 detailed paragraph, focusing on ozone data:

The study analyzes tropospheric ozone distributions and trends using IASI (Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer) and CrIS (Cross-track Infrared Sounder) satellite datasets from 2008 to present. The analysis reveals a global increase in daytime and nighttime ozone concentrations, with regional variations observed. The trend is consistent with the Tropospheric Ozone Assessment Report, which shows an increase in tropospheric ozone, although uncertainties persist due to discrepancies between ultraviolet and infrared instruments. The IASI dataset provides a homogeneous Climate Data Record for ozone, while CrIS data was processed by JPL's TROPESS team. The study compares trends derived from both datasets on global, hemispheric, and regional scales, as well as over selected cities, finding good agreement with ozonesonde measurements.
