Here is a summary of the study in 1 detailed paragraph, focusing on the information and data related to ozone:

The study assessed air pollution in Samarinda, Indonesia using the C4.5 algorithm, which classified air quality data based on six measurement parameters: PM10, PM2.5, CO, O3, and NO2. The results showed that ozone (O3) is a harmful pollutant on the Earth's surface, capable of damaging lungs and other respiratory systems. Ozone levels are important for determining air quality, with the World Health Organization (WHO) setting an annual quality standard value of 20Î¼g/m3. In Samarinda, the C4.5 algorithm achieved a success rate of 99.5074% and a failure rate of 0.4926% when processing air quality data, effectively classifying air quality into good and moderate categories with different proportions each day. The study highlights the importance of providing accurate air quality information to mitigate respiratory issues, particularly in Samarinda where high levels of pollution result from heavy vehicle exhaust emissions.
