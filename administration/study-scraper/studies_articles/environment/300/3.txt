Density functional theory (DFT) simulations and intermediate identification facilitated the elucidation of three main degradation pathways: dehydrogenation, cycloaddition, and hydroxylation. •OH and SO4•- radicals were found to attack UV328 through hydrogen atom abstraction channels, while 1O2-mediated cycloaddition reactions played a key role in the degradation process. The results also suggested that O3/PMS treatment reduced the ecological risks of UV328.
