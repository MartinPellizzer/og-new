In conclusion, this study demonstrates the potential of ozone generated via DBD plasma reactor for heavy naphtha desulfurization. The results highlight the effectiveness of the non-thermal plasma technology in removing sulfur-containing compounds from fuel products. Further research is needed to optimize the process and explore its application to other petroleum products, but the findings of this study suggest a promising future for this technology in the petroleum industry.
