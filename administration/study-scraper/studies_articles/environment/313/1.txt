The experiments were conducted in a laboratory chamber, where limonene was oxidized in the presence of GUV222 or O3 light. The chamber was equipped with various instruments to measure the concentration of ozone, nitric oxide (NO), and organic compounds. The experiments also included the addition of NO2 and nitrous acid (HONO) to examine their influence on SOA formation. Additionally, outdoor air samples were collected and analyzed to compare the results with those obtained in the laboratory.
