Here is a summary of the study in 1 detailed paragraph:

The study investigates the relationship between solar activity, geomagnetic indices, polar ozone levels, and the COVID-19 pandemic. The research found that changes in polar ozone levels under the influence of solar radiation are linked to variations in geomagnetic indices and solar activity. The analysis reveals that geophysical processes, such as changes in galactic cosmic rays and UV radiation during solar cycle minima, can foster favorable conditions for pandemics. Specifically, the study shows that the COVID-19 pandemic coincided with heightened solar activity after the 24th solar cycle's minimum and the secular maximum of GCRs, which led to geomagnetic disturbances and reduced TO levels in both hemispheres, exacerbating the pandemic waves and accelerating case development.
