Abstract
New industries are proliferating in the recovery of agri-food wastes, such as those involved in the revaluation of alperujo, generated in the production of olive oil. Despite the potential environmental benefits, their activity is not exempt from new forms of emissions, aggravated by the massification of waste treatments.
This work reports a six-month field campaign carried out in an alperujo desiccation plant which can serve as a proxy for these emerging industries in the Mediterranean countries. The study focused on air quality parameters, covering criteria pollutants, metals and microbiological load of particulate matter and the characterization of volatile organic compounds (VOCs).
The results show a slight contribution of the factory to the NOx levels in the surroundings (3.0–12.5 μg/m3). Statistically significant effects were not observed for ozone, CO, SO2, or PM10. Concerning the levels of metals, concentrations were low and calculated health risk indexes indicated safe conditions in the area. The most abundant elements were Na (6.5 × 102 ng/m3), K (4.0 × 102 ng/m3), Al (2.7 × 102 ng/m3), Zn (2.1 × 102 ng/m3), Ca (2.16 × 102 ng/m3), Fe (3.6 × 101 ng/m3) and Mg (3.2 × 101 ng/m3).
Bacterial counts, with a mean value of 15.9 CFU/m3, showed a seasonal shift, mainly explained by weather (air moisture and temperature) and PM2.5 concentration. The genomic analysis showed Cutibacterium as the dominant genus during the cold months while Bacillus predominated in the warm season.
The VOCs with higher average concentrations were acetic acid (130 μg/m3), nonanoic acid (124 μg/m3), benzoic acid (29.7 μg/m3), octanoic acid (19.9 μg/m3) and nonanal (4.70 μg/m3), with the rest of compounds in concentrations below 4 μg/m3. Odorant pollutants with the greatest contribution to olfactory nuisance were aldehydes (from pentanaldehyde to decanaldehyde), acetic acid and phenol.
Although the observable effects of the waste treatments were low, several parameters showed an influence on the environment which should be assessed to foresee and prevent long-term consequences.

1. Introduction
Olive oil production has tripled in the last 60 years, reaching 3266500 t in the 2019/20 crop year (
IOC, 2024
). Most of the cultivated area, around 97%, is found in Mediterranean countries, with Spain being the world's leading producer. Nevertheless, despite the culinary, social, or economic benefits of olive oil industry, environmental concerns have to be considered since residues or wastes have increased parallelly to production. Thus, olive mill wastes (OMW) are the main residues in the extraction of olive oil, amounting around 80% of the initial olives mass w/w, (
Hernández et al., 2014
). Additionally, water is required during the extraction and contributes to the final residues.
Currently, most olive mills have installed the known as “two phases” extraction procedure which generates olive oil, and alperujo as OMW. Despite its natural origin, alperujo cannot be directly used as soil fertilizer due to its fitotoxic effects. (
Martın et al., 2002
;
Leontopoulos et al., 2020
;
Bouhia et al., 2023
). Alperujo is generally stored in large open-air ponds and due to its high acidity, antimicrobial activity and fitotoxicity, it is hardly degraded biologically (
Abbattista et al., 2021
). Thus, this OMW may constitute a significant problem for the sustainability of the olive trees cultivation and olive oil industry if it can't be eliminated or exploited for further applications.
Due to its composition, alperujo can potentially be used to produce pomace olive oil, biodiesel fuels, pellets for combustion, compost, food, non-hazardous organic phytochemicals, etc. (
Hernández et al., 2018
;
Leontopoulos et al., 2020
;
Foti et al., 2022
;
Bouhia et al., 2023
). Nevertheless, for most applications, the large water content of alperujo, 60–70%, must be previously reduced to levels below 10%. In the past most olive mills had evaporation ponds, or olive wastes were directly dumped into the environment. Recently, due to the environmental restrictions and the emerging possibilities to valorize and use olive residues, different industries have appeared, such as alperujo desiccation plants, that can be considered as a necessary tool in the establishment of a Circular Economy. However, there are different environmental aspects that must be evaluated. For example, these drying plants agglutinate the storage and management of alperujo from different production areas and mills. And it is this massive concentration of OMW and its treatment that can constitute a significant pollution source for soil, water, and air in the vicinity of the industry. Therefore, it is necessary to assess the environmental and health effects in the surroundings of these agri-food waste operation plants. Although there are numerous studies about the composition and potential uses of alperujo, there are still very few studies regarding the effect on air quality in the regions that massively concentrate the storage and treatment of this waste (
Nasini et al., 2016
;
Hernández et al., 2018
).
Apart from the direct emissions from the storage ponds, an additional atmospheric source of VOCs is the thermal treatment of alperujo. In the desiccation ovens, vaporization of volatile compounds or even the decomposition or transformation of the most unstable ones occurs. Thus, together with water vapor, particulate matter (PM), condensable products, SO2, NOx, benzene, xylenes, chlorobenzenes, furans, alcohols, and other VOCs may be emitted (
Fagernäs et al., 2010
). Additionally, the emission of odorous compounds (
Ruiz-Méndez et al., 2013
) generally induce and triggers complaints from the surrounding populations.
Previous studies show that the presence of high concentrations of phenolic compounds in OMW has negative effects on insects, fungi, bacteria, and plants (
Babić et al., 2019
;
Bailón-Salas et al., 2021
), and can act as a strong “natural” chemosterilant (
Di Ilio and Cristofaro, 2020
). In fact, OMW has applications in the field of pest control, against bacterial, fungal phytopathogens, insects and weed species (
El-Abbassi et al., 2017
;
Leontopoulos et al., 2020
;
Bailón-Salas et al., 2021
). Nevertheless, it is not yet known if undesired emissions of phenolic compounds from large evaporation ponds can have an effect on the flora, fauna and crops in the surrounding areas, especially if natural protected areas are close.
This study is aimed to the assessment of the potential effects of massive treatment of OMW on air quality parameters. In this sense, this work reports a six month campaign of field measurements in an industrial facility designed for the storage, desiccation and use of OMW from many cooperatives and private mills. The study assesses the temporal evolution of different air quality parameters such as criteria pollutants, a wide set of VOCs, PM, metals, fungi and bacteria. The results from this study may serve as reference for similar olive oil industries in the Mediterranean countries in the assessment of the environmental impact of revalorization treatments of alperujo on the surroundings.
2. Material and methods
2.1. Measurement site
The studied industry agglutinates six cooperatives in the North of Ciudad Real Province (in south-central Spain) and 7500 members with an olive production of around 4.0 × 104 tons/year, mainly aimed at the production of olive oil. In addition, the desiccation plant collects alperujo from oil mills of other towns, having a maximum treatment capacity of 600 tons/day. The alperujo drying process is centralized in a single plant (39°09′1.46"N 3°52′25.72"W) placed in a rural location approximately at 3 km southwest of Malagón, 6 km from “Las Navas” Nature Reserve and about 15 km from Las “Tablas de Daimiel” National Park (PNTD), also declared as UNESCO biosphere reserve (
Fig. S1
).
As for the nearby town, Malagón with 7842 inhabitants (2022 census), it has a basically agricultural economy, mainly based on barley, vineyards, and olive trees. Olive oil, cheese and wine industries are also significant. The region is characterized by hot dry summers with maximum temperatures around 40 °C in summer and humid cold winters, with minimum temperatures around -5 °C. Two different landscapes are present, the flat high plateau of “La Mancha” with altitude ranging from 600 to 700m, in the East, and a hill chain in the North and West (“Montes de Toledo-Sierra de Malagón”) with peaks around 1000m. The desiccating plant is close (at 100m distance) to the N401 national road that connects Ciudad Real (25 km to the South) with Toledo (90 km to the North).
The industrial process begins with the transport by road of the alperujo produced in different oil mills during December and January. This vegetal waste is stored in large pools (
Fig. S1b
) and the desiccation campaign proceeds for months until all the alperujo has been removed. A constant flow of alperujo is partially dehydrated by using centrifugal decanters which also extract olive stones. Subsequently (
Gomez-de la Cruz et al., 2017
), a drying phase occurs heating by means of a trommel-type evaporator which reduces the humidity to 10% or below, leading to a dry solid fat pomace as the final product. This pomace may be treated in extractor factories that obtain pomace olive oil using solvents and generate a de-oiled pomace as a by-product which is useful as biofuel. In fact, this defatted solid waste is used in the study desiccation plant as the main fuel for all its processes, thus reducing waste to a minimum, in line with the circular economy production and consumption model. Furthermore, olive stone residues may be converted to pellets or directly sold as solid fuel for industrial or domestic heating.
Thus, in the plant there are pools of alperujo and water from the decanters, and mounds of olive stones, solid fat and defatted pomace. The main emissions from the plant are the visible plume from the 22m high, 1.9m diameter chimney and the evaporation from the pools,
Fig. S1
. The desiccation plant is intended to operate continuously and under ideal conditions all the stored alperujo is usually processed before summer. Nevertheless, during the study campaign several breakdowns and a long transport strike forced the shutdown of the plant on many dates.
2.2. Field measurements
The gas analyzers used to measure NOx, ozone, CO and SO2 surface concentrations were T200P, T400, T300, and T100U, respectively, and have been described elsewhere (
Viteri et al., 2023
). They were installed inside a cabin with thermal regulation to preserve them from the rain and from the ambient temperature changes to keep the sampling manifold at 22 ± 2 °C. PM10, was measured by the β-ray absorption method with a Met One instrument, BAM 1022, with a heated inlet to dry the aerosol samples. All the analyzers were placed at 50 m from the evaporator and 150 m from the alperujo ponds.

VOCs were measured by sampling air with an automated programmable sampler, Markes MTS-32. It enables the placement of up to 32 sorbing tubes which were sequentially open at a constant flow rate for the assigned time period and then closed until the last sample was collected. Multi-bed tubes (Tenax TA/Carbograph 1TD/Carboxen 1003), from Markes, designed to fix VOCs in the range C3 to C30, were used. For each tube the sampling time was 6 h in the range times 0:00–06:00, 06:00–12:00, 12:00–18:00 and 18:00–0:00, for a total air volume set at 9–10L. The tubes were then analyzed in the laboratory through thermal desorption (TD-30R Shimadzu), and subsequent GC-MS analysis under conventional MS or MS-MS procedures with a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer, GC–MS TQ804, Shimadzu.
For the assessment of metals, fungi and bacteria in air aerosols, air samples were collected through 47 mm fiberglass filters (Whatman) using a PM2.5 analyzer, Derenda LVS3.1 (2.3 m3/h). Each filter was placed to trap the particulate matter in the air pumped along a whole week. Finally, the filters were
