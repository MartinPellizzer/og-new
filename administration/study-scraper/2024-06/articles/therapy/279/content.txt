Here are five detailed paragraphs using the information from the scientific study:

**Paragraph 1**
Herpes zoster (HZ) is a common and painful condition caused by the reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus. The annual incidence of HZ is high in middle-aged and elderly adults, with approximately 9 to 34 individuals out of 100 developing postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). PHN is the most common complication of HZ, significantly affecting the quality of life of patients and being the primary reason for clinical treatment. Early treatment is recommended to improve therapeutic effects and prevent PHN occurrence.

**Paragraph 2**
This study was a prospective, randomized, controlled trial that recruited patients with acute HZ neuralgia from February 2022 to 2023. A total of 164 patients were randomly assigned to two groups: the pulsed radiofrequency combined with ozone injection group (group A) and the pulsed radiofrequency group (group B). Patients underwent CT-guided PRF or ozone injection under local anesthesia, with the procedures performed by the same investigator. The primary outcome was the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) scores and the incidence of clinically significant PHN.

**Paragraph 3**
The results showed that both groups had significantly lower NRS scores and doses of gabapentin after treatment compared to baseline values. Compared to group B, group A had significantly lower NRS scores and doses of postoperative gabapentin. The incidence of PHN was significantly lower at weeks 4, 12, and 24 in group A than in group B. No adverse reactions occurred in either group during the study period.

**Paragraph 4**
The study's findings suggest that ozone injection in the dorsal root ganglion combined with pulsed radiofrequency therapy is more effective in treating acute HZ neuralgia in middle-aged and elderly adults. The combination treatment provides patients with longer-lasting pain relief, decreased incidence of PHN, and reduced doses of medication compared to pulsed radiofrequency alone.

**Paragraph 5**
In conclusion, the study demonstrates that ozone injection combined with pulsed radiofrequency therapy is a promising approach for treating acute HZ neuralgia in middle-aged and elderly adults. The treatment provides patients with improved pain relief, reduced incidence of PHN, and better quality of life compared to conventional treatments. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings and explore the long-term effects of this combination therapy.
