The results of the study revealed that atmospheric molecular mechanisms initiate the oxidation of 1-hexene from room temperature up to combustion temperatures, leading to the formation of highly oxygenated organic molecules. At lower temperatures, the reaction produces ketohydroperoxides and molecules containing up to nine O atoms. As temperature increases, the highly oxygenated organic molecules contribute to radical-branching decomposition pathways, inducing a high reactivity in the low-temperature combustion region.
