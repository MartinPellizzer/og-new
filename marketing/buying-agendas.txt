Step 7: Summary and Recommendations
Summary: Based on the buyer profile of John Stevens, the most relevant and influential buying agendas are The Protector and The Doctor, both scoring 20. These agendas align closely with John's core problem of maintaining high sanitization standards in a cost-effective and eco-friendly manner. The Nurturer agenda also has significant influence, highlighting John's desire to care for his employees and customers. The Warrior agenda, though less intense, can be leveraged to underscore John's ambition to lead in industry standards.

Recommendations:

Prioritize The Protector and The Doctor Agendas:

Marketing Messages: Focus on safety, health, and compliance. Emphasize how the Ozone Sanitization System ensures a spotless, germ-free environment, protecting customers and employees.
Emotional Triggers: Use testimonials and case studies showcasing improved health and reduced risks.
Incorporate The Nurturer Agenda:

Marketing Messages: Highlight the system's benefits in creating a caring and safe environment for employees and customers.
Emotional Triggers: Share stories of how businesses have improved employee morale and customer trust through superior sanitization.
Leverage The Warrior Agenda:

Marketing Messages: Position the system as an advanced, cutting-edge technology that sets John's business apart as a leader in hygiene and safety.
Emotional Triggers: Use language that conveys strength, innovation, and leadership.
Conflict Management:

Balance messaging to ensure that care (Nurturer) and leadership (Warrior) are seen as complementary. For example, "By leading in hygiene standards, you show how much you care about your community's well-being."
By focusing on these agendas and resolving potential conflicts, the marketing strategy can deeply resonate with John's unconscious motivations, driving him towards a buying decision that feels both logical and emotionally satisfying.
