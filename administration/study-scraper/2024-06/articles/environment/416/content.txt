Here are the five detailed paragraphs based on the scientific study:

**Paragraph 1**
The quality of air is a pressing concern worldwide, and monitoring its pollution levels is crucial for ensuring public health. In Peru, the Organismo de Evaluación y Fiscalización Ambiental (OEFA) conducted a monitoring study to assess the air quality in the vicinity of the ETERNIT company, located in the Asentamiento Humano El Planeta, Cercado de Lima. This study aimed to provide valuable insights into the levels of pollutants in the area and identify potential health risks.

**Paragraph 2**
The methods employed by the OEFA team involved a five-day monitoring period from June 20th to 24th, 2014. The team collected air samples using a portable spectrophotometer and analyzed them for the presence of sulfur dioxide (SO2), hydrogen sulfide (H2S), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and ozone (O3). Additionally, particulate matter less than 10 microns in diameter (PM10) was also measured. The monitoring stations were located at a distance of approximately 100 meters from the ETERNIT company.

**Paragraph 3**
The results showed that the concentrations of SO2, H2S, NO2, CO, and O3 obtained during the monitoring period did not exceed the National Environmental Standards for Air Quality (SENAMA). The levels of PM10 were also found to be below the permissible limits. Interestingly, the wind patterns in the area favored a southerly direction from the ETERNIT company towards the Asentamiento Humano El Planeta.

**Paragraph 4**
The discussion highlights the importance of monitoring air quality near industrial sites like ETERNIT. The study's findings suggest that the levels of pollutants in the area are within acceptable limits, alleviating concerns about potential health risks to nearby residents. However, further studies are needed to confirm these results and monitor any changes in air quality over time.

**Paragraph 5**
In conclusion, this study demonstrates the effectiveness of monitoring air quality near industrial sites like ETERNIT. The findings provide valuable information for policymakers, healthcare professionals, and concerned citizens alike. Future studies should focus on long-term monitoring and investigating the impact of industrial activities on local air quality. By doing so, we can better understand and mitigate the effects of pollution on public health and the environment.
