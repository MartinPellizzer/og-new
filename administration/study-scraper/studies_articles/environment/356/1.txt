To achieve this goal, the study employed various methods, including gridded air pollutant and population data, k-means clustering to atmospheric reanalysis data, radar-derived rainfall data, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to predict cloud-to-ground lightning. The researchers also used a suite of reanalysis-derived meteorological variables as predictors in the CNN models.
