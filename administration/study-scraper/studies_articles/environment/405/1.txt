The study used a mixed-methods approach, combining published literature reviews and data analysis to estimate the economic costs of disease based on healthcare use and productivity loss. Annual PM2.5 levels from 2014 to 2023 were also analyzed to understand the trends in air pollution over time. The results are presented for Delhi, Dhaka, and Lahore, with a focus on ground-level ozone and particulate matter (PM2.5).
