Here is a detailed summary of the study, focusing on ozone-related information and data, within the 60-80 word limit:

Ground-based monitoring of stratospheric ozone and temperature in Germany since the 1960s shows long-term changes similar to global trends. Ozone depletion occurred from the 1960s to the 1990s due to increasing ozone-depleting substances, followed by a leveling or slight increase since around 2000, consistent with declining ODS levels. Around 40 km altitude, ozone recovery is evident, attributed to decreasing stratospheric chlorine loading and upper stratosphere cooling.
