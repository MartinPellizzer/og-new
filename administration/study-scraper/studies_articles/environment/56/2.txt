The results showed that short-term exposure to high levels of both PM2.5 and O3 significantly increased the risk of total nonaccidental mortality, cardiovascular disease deaths, and respiratory disease deaths compared to low levels of both pollutants. The effect of O3 on total nonaccidental mortality at high PM2.5 levels was particularly pronounced, with a relative excess risk of interaction and synergy index of 0.69% and 1.31, respectively.
