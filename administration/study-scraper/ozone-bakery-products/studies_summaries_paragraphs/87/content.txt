Here is a summary of the study in one detailed paragraph, focusing on ozone-related information and data:

Exposure to gaseous ozone at concentrations ranging from 0.3 to 1.0 ppm significantly delayed the development of green and blue molds on artificially inoculated citrus fruit, with a delay of approximately one week observed. Ozone exposure did not reduce final incidence of disease, but sporulation was prevented or reduced without noticeable phytotoxicity to the fruit. A synergistic effect between ozone exposure and low temperature was observed in preventing sporulation, suggesting potential benefits for postharvest storage. Additionally, ozone exposure at 0.3 ppm significantly reduced radial growth of Penicillium italicum in vitro, while a previous exposure to ozone did not affect susceptibility of oranges to decay. Overall, these findings suggest that gaseous ozone could be an effective tool in controlling postharvest decay on citrus fruit.
