Here is a summary of the study in one paragraph focusing on ozone-related information and data:

The study investigates the combination of photocatalytic oxidation and ozonation to advance wastewater treatment, particularly for removing organic micro-pollutants. Ozone (O3) was found to form partly unknown transformation products during oxidation, whose toxicological properties are often unknown or problematic. In contrast, hydroxyl radicals (OHâ€¢), formed through photocatalysis using titanium dioxide and UV-A LEDs, exhibit increased oxidation strength and enable non-specific advanced chemical wastewater treatment. The combination of photocatalysis and ozonation can lead to a synergetic increase in efficiency, but the practical implementation and purification performance in real-world applications is insufficiently known. The study aims to investigate the behavior of organic wastewater matrix during photocatalytic treatment, transformation products formed, and their correlation with parent substance degradation.
