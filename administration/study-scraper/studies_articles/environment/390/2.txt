The results of the meta-analysis showed that elevated O3 concentrations significantly increased MDA content, SOD activity, and POD activity in herbaceous plants. The effects varied depending on plant species, O3 concentration, and exposure duration. For example, rice was found to be more resistant to elevated O3 than wheat and ornamental herbs, likely due to the higher activity of antioxidant components in the symplasts. Exposure to elevated O3 for >60 days may result in antioxidant SOD losing its regulatory ability.
