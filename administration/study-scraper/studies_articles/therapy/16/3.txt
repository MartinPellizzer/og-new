The findings of this study support the notion that anti-aging integrative therapy can have a beneficial impact on cellular aging and quality of life. The increases in telomere length and reductions in biological age suggest that the treatment may help to reverse or at least slow down the aging process. Additionally, the improvements observed in various aging symptoms further underscore the potential benefits of this therapeutic approach.
