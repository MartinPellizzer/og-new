In conclusion, this study provides new insights into the omics responses of plants to ozone, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter. By understanding how plants respond to air pollution at the molecular level, researchers can identify potential strategies for improving plant tolerance and developing sustainable solutions for mitigating urban air pollution. Future studies should focus on field-based research and the identification of tolerant plant species to inform the development of effective NBS for reducing the impacts of air pollution on ecosystems and human health.
