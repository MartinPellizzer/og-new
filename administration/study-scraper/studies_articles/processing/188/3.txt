The findings of this study have important implications for understanding the virulence of Fusarium strains in wheat. The results suggest that different Fusarium species exhibit distinct toxin-producing abilities, which may influence their impact on wheat crops. Additionally, the fumigation experiments highlight the potential benefits of chlorine dioxide and ozone as effective methods for controlling Fusarium growth and reducing mycotoxin production.
