The findings suggest that the photocatalytic process integrating magnetic nanocomposites can be a viable solution for micropollutant removal from wastewater. The use of nanoparticles enhances the oxidation reaction by increasing the surface area and reactivity of the catalysts. The reactor configurations and operational conditions play a crucial role in optimizing the performance of the process. Further research is needed to scale up the process and explore its application in real-world scenarios.
