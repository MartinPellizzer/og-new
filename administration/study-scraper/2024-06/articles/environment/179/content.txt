Here are five detailed paragraphs based on the scientific study:

**Paragraph 1**
Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is a significant air pollutant that has been linked to adverse health effects and climate impacts. In the UK, PM2.5 emissions have been reducing in recent years due to pollution control strategies. However, this reduction may have unintended consequences on tropospheric ozone (O3) concentrations, which are also a concern for human health. This study aims to investigate the impact of PM2.5 emission reductions on O3 concentrations in the UK using 10-year measurement data from 2010 to 2019.

**Paragraph 2**
The measurement data used in this study were extracted from the UK's national compliance monitoring network, the Automatic Urban and Rural Monitoring Network (AURN) data archive. The AURN records hourly measurements of O3, NOx, and PM2.5 concentrations across 170 air quality monitoring stations in the UK. The daily mean NOx and PM2.5 data were calculated from measured hourly concentrations, while the measured O3 data were obtained as the daily maximum 8 h running mean (MDA8). The data selection specifically avoided measurements taken during the COVID-19 pandemic.

**Paragraph 3**
The results of this study show that there is a strong positive correlation between [NO] vs. [PM2.5] and [O3] vs. [PM2.5] for the Urban Traffic site type overall. However, individual sites revealed varying correlations. Notably, the London Marylebone Road (LMR) site showed a negative [O3] vs. [PM2.5] gradient in years preceding a sharp 35% PM2.5 decrease between 2011 and 2015. The Birmingham measurement sites did not display a significant correlation due to lower-average absolute initial PM2.5 concentrations and absence of a significant continuous mean PM2.5 decline.

**Paragraph 4**
The study's findings suggest that PM2.5 reductions are a more significant factor in causing O3 increases, as suppression of O3 production by PM2.5 chemistry decreases with declining [PM2.5]. The results imply the presence of a threshold initial PM2.5 concentration (t) above which O3 suppression by PM2.5 chemistry is sufficient to induce O3 increases when average PM2.5 concentrations significantly decline (by >26% across >2 years), where 17 μg m−3 < t < 26 μg m−3.

**Paragraph 5**
In conclusion, this study demonstrates the importance of considering the impact of PM2.5 emission reductions on O3 concentrations in air pollution policies. The findings highlight that significant reductions in PM2.5 can lead to increases in O3 concentrations, especially in areas with high initial PM2.5 levels. The proposed threshold initial PM2.5 concentration (t) provides a valuable tool for predicting the likelihood of O3 increases following PM2.5 reductions. Further research is needed to refine this threshold and understand the influence of other factors, such as the street canyon effect, on O3-O3 relationships in different urban environments.
