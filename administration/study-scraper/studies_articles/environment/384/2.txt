The results of the study highlight the correlation between O3 formation and O3 precursor levels, particularly NOx and VOCs. It was found that O3 levels are contingent on diurnal, day-of-week, and seasonally-dependent factors, influencing the "weekend effect" phenomenon, where O3 concentrations exhibit higher levels during weekends compared to weekdays. Notably, the study reveals opposing features during Arizona's two summer seasons, in which O3 regimes reverse from VOC-sensitive (in dry summer) to NOx-sensitive (in monsoon summer).
