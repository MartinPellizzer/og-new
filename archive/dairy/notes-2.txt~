MILK
====================================================

pharmaceutical residues:
	- antibiotics and other drugs
	- trat bacterial and parasite infections
	- for mastitis (infection of mammary gland) in lactating cows
	- as slow release preparations, in dry cow therapy
	- in cases of insufficient withrawal period or increased or
	  incorredtly administerd dosage, resudue may occur in milk
	- public health concerns about antibiotis in cheese milk
		- emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains
		- inpact on human intestinal flora
		- potential for allergic reactions
	- drug residues pose technologial problems due to their inibition of
	  the growth of starter cultures and acid production	
	- antibiotic residues concern in cheesemaking
	- standard practice at large-scale cheese manufactureplants to analyze
	  for the presence of antibiotics in cheese milk
	- analysis not as available at small-scale or artisanal facilities
	- conentration of antibiotics to inhibit sarter cultures depend on the
	  strain used and on the antibioci type
	- in general, lactic acid bacteria are more sensitive to penicillin than
	  to cloxacillin
	- lactococci more sensitive to streptomycin and tetracyline 
		- and more resistant to penicillin than S. thermophilus and
		  thermophilic lactobacilli
	- lactobacillus delbrueckii supsp. lactis and l. helveticus are less
	  resistant to penicillin than most strains of l. casei
		- and l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus
		- and propionibactrium freudenreichii are less resistant to
		  penicillin than lactobacilli
	- antibiotics may ingluence the associative growht between two species
	  when growing together
	- in ceddar-type cheese manufacture
		- lower level of antibiotic residues results in reduced rate
		  of acidification
		- especially in drain-to-salting period, which necessitates
		  longer manufacture times
		- may ingluence moisutre content
		- and result in higher cheede pH
	- high levels antibiotic residues result in cessation of acidification
	  after renetting
		- and abnormally high cheesee pH
		- cheese may have an uneven texture and pasty body
		- with abnormal flavors, like yeasty, rancid, remented
	- ihibit frowth of nonstarter lactic acid bacteria
		- reduce flavor inensity, paricularly in raw-milk cheeses
	- in brine-salted cheeses
		- ab residues inhibit starter growth and acidification
			- resulting in poor curd syneresis
			- soft curd particles with excessive whey content
			- curd with elevated misture content
	- coliforms are not inhibited by antiviotics like penicillin
		- can increase in numbers nad produce gas
		- forms numerous holed in the curd
	- in swiss-type chesses manufactured with propionic acid bacteris
		- abnorma fermentstions occur
		- icluding butyric acid fermentation
		- development of abnormal eyes, slits, cracks, brown spots
		  sicoloration, putrfaction
		- development of wet, slimy surface, with string off-odor may
		  also occur
	- drug residues from antibiotics or parasites treatment (e. flukicide)
	  generally not concern in large-scale processing facilities
	- but in small-scale, where milk from single herd, or small number,
	  residues may be issue
	- even if flukicide residues not detectable in milk, still result in
	  detectable levels in cheese
	- have appropriate limitation in dosafe nad withdrawal periods

influence of cold storage of cheese milk
	- dissociation of micelle components
		- combination of refrigerated storage of milk at farm/factory
		  impats cheesmaking properties
		- cold storage of milk (>24h) release caseins, calcium,
		  magnesium, phosphate, citrate from casein micelles
		- including dissociation of B-casein to level >40g/100g of
		  total b-casein
		- milk pH will increase 0.1-0.3 units
		- partially reversible when linked to decreased ionization of
		  water and calcium phosphate
		- partially irreversible due to loss of CO2 from milk
		- increased rennet coagulation time
			- and delayed aggreation 
			- may be a consequence of b-casein migrating from the
			  micellar to the serum phase
			- also inceresed levels of hydrolysis by plasmin
			- reslt in further decrease in hydorphobic
			  interactions and increase micelle stability
			- reduced curd firmness and lower cheese yield
		- rennet coagulation time is increased further where milk
		  thermized prior to cold storage
		- cheese milk cold-stored for up to 14, coagulation properties
		  where not impaired significantly 
		- and were markedly improved by acidification
		- improvement in coagulation properties after acidification
		  and addition of CaCl2
			- striger correlation of RCT with pH rather than Ca2+
			  contentration
		- paseurization of cold-stored milk results in recovery of
		  coagulation properties to some extent
			- by reversing changes in the casein micelle structure
			- particularly when CaCl2 is added 
			- but HTST pasteruization had no significat effect on
			  the coagulation properties
			- even though the renet coagulation time (RTC) was
			  reduced by 7 min
	- enzymatic and microbial degradation
		- cold storage may also result in biochemical changes
			- due to growth of psychrotrophic bacteria
		- the rate of spy bacteria achieve a level of contamination
		  necessary for spoilage (>10^6cfu/mL)		
			- depends on initial number after milking 
			- and duration of cold storage of raw milk
		- psy (pseudomonas and bacillus species) prduce extracellular
		  or intracellular proteases, lipases, and phospholipahses
			- resistant to pasteurization and contribute to cheese
			  spoilage
		- proteinases stimulate release of plasmin and plasminogen
			- from casein miceles into the whey fraction 
			- affecting flavor and texture development of cheeses
		- proteinases hydrolize alphas-beta-casins
			- especially b-casein is dissociated from the casein
			  midelles
			- resulting in increased NPN
			- and reduced cheeses yeld
			- and influence accessibility of rennet to k-casein
			- which ingluence coagulation properties
