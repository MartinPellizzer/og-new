Here is a summary of the study in 1 detailed paragraph focusing on ozone:

The study presents an experimental-numerical approach to determine the tearing energy threshold for crack growth in rubber exposed to ozone, a key criterion for assessing its resistance. The methodology involves in-situ optical analysis of ozone-induced crack growth and determination of crack growth rates while stretching the rubber. Energy release rates at crack tips were calculated using finite element method simulations. By comparing these with experimentally measured crack growth rates, the energy release rate interval corresponding to the threshold tearing energy was determined. The study found a maximum tearing energy threshold of 2.12 J/m2 for carbon black reinforced natural rubber exposed to ozone, which is 96% lower than that of non-ozone-exposed specimens. This novel methodology can efficiently determine the ozone threshold tearing energy and represents a powerful tool for developing environmentally friendly antiozonants.
