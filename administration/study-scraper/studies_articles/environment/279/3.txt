The findings suggest that climate change has a significant impact on asthma, particularly in children. Future research should quantify the impact of global change in climate regarding the distribution of aeroallergens in terms of geography and time. It is also essential to investigate the impact of air pollution on asthmatic health, including sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), and particles having an aerodynamic diameter lower than 2.5 µm (PM2.5).
