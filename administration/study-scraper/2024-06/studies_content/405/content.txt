Abstract: This study used online monitoring instruments to obtain the hourly concentration data of 107 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the ambient atmosphere of Xianning City from June to August 2021, and compared the composition and sources of VOCs on ozone-polluted days and non-polluted days in Xianning City. During the observation period, the daily average concentration of VOCs ozone pollution was 16.6×10<sup>-9</sup>, and the average daily concentration of non-pollution was 13.9×10<sup>-9</sup>. The proportion of various VOCs concentrations on ozone pollution days is alkanes (31.3%)&gt;acetone (25.6%)&gt;halogenated hydrocarbons (13.6%)&gt;OVOCs (8.8%)&gt;olefins (7.6%)&gt;acetylenes (6.9%)&gt;aromatics hydrocarbons (6.2%), using the maximum reaction increment (MIR) to estimate the contribution of various VOCs to the ozone generation potential (OFP), specifically olefins (49.4%)&gt;aromatic hydrocarbons (16.2%)&gt;OVOCs (13.9%)&gt;alkanes (11.6%)&gt;acetylenes (4.3%). The monitoring data was input into the PMFmodel, and the results showed that, the main sources of VOCs on pollution days were motor vehicle emission sources and industrial emission sources, and the main sources of VOCs on non-pollution days were motor vehicle emission sources.
