Here are the five detailed paragraphs using the information and data from the scientific study:

**Paragraph 1: Introduction**
Chlorine plays a crucial role in atmospheric chemistry, and marine chloride depletion is a significant source of atmospheric chlorine. As a result, it has a profound impact on coastal acid deposition, atmospheric oxidizing capacity, and global climate. In this study, we investigated variations in chloride depletion and its related impact factors at the Chongming Dongtan supersite in Shanghai from 2019 to 2022.

**Paragraph 2: Methods**
The methods used in this study included continuous monitoring of PM2.5 water-soluble ions, criteria pollutants, and meteorological data at the Chongming Dongtan supersite. We also employed trajectory analysis via the Concentration Weighted Trajectory (CWT) method to identify the main source regions contributing to chloride depletion. Additionally, we used the community atmospheric chemistry box model Chemistry As A Box model Application/Module Efﬁciently Calculating the Chemistry of the Atmosphere (CAABA/MECCA) to analyze the contribution of typical chloride depletion processes to ozone.

**Paragraph 3: Results**
Our results show that chloride depletion increases in summer and decreases in winter. Chloride depletion also exhibits a diurnal pattern, reaching its peak around noon and gradually decreasing after 6 p.m. CWT analysis reveals that airflows predominantly originate from the ocean during periods of chloride depletion. Furthermore, we found that oceanic chlorine depletion contributes approximately 8 ppb, 0.1 ppt, and 18 ppt to the enhancement of O3, OH·, and HO2· concentrations.

**Paragraph 4: Discussion**
Our findings highlight the significance of ship emissions through chloride depletion mechanisms in coastal port cities like Shanghai. The liquid-phase reactions of N2O5 with sea-salt aerosol via liquid-phase reactions result in chloride depletion. Therefore, attention should be paid to the contribution of ship emissions to O3 pollution in these areas. Additionally, our study demonstrates that chloride depletion serves as a typical indicator of the impact of chloride circulation on coastal ozone.

**Paragraph 5: Conclusion**
In conclusion, this study provides valuable insights into variations in chloride depletion and its impacts on ozone formation at the Chongming Dongtan supersite in Shanghai. Our results suggest that attention should be paid to the contribution of ship emissions through chloride depletion mechanisms to O3 pollution in coastal port cities like Shanghai. The findings of this study can inform policymakers and air quality managers in their efforts to mitigate O3 pollution and improve air quality in these regions.
