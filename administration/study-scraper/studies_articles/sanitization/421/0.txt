The removal of antibiotics from pharmaceutical wastewater is a pressing concern due to their adverse effects on the environment and human health. Various treatment processes have been employed to eliminate these pollutants, but many remain ineffective. To address this issue, researchers have turned to photocatalytic ozonation-electroflucculation (POE) as a promising approach. This study investigates the effectiveness of POE using modified bentonite/UV/TiO2/ZnO for the treatment of real pharmaceutical wastewater.
