The results showed that the UV Erythema index is significantly higher during the summer months, particularly in July with a value of approximately 12.06, indicating an extreme level requiring protective shields. A clear negative correlation was observed between total ozone and UV-index, demonstrating a power relationship (∝〖To〗^(-1.635)) for warm months (May, June, and July). Additionally, the study found that UV indexes for cities with different altitudes increase by about 11 percent every kilometer.
