Here is a summary of the study in one paragraph, focusing on the information and data related to ozone:

The study examined the impact of land use patterns on air pollution in western Tehran, with a focus on creating health buffers around sensitive areas such as schools, hospitals, and residential zones. The analysis revealed that industrial areas, particularly in region 21, have contributed significantly to air pollution due to the accumulation of industrial and workshop uses, emitting pollutants like ozone (O3), particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, and volatile organic compounds. The findings suggest that the pattern of urban land use plays a crucial role in shaping differences in exposure to air pollution among population groups, with green spaces and low-density residential areas associated with improved air quality and acting as natural buffers against pollution.
