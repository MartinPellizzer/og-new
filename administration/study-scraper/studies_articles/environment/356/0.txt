Cloud-to-ground lightning occurring with little to no rainfall – typically referred to as “dry lightning” – is a major source of wildfire ignition in the western United States (WUS) during summer months. Dry lightning poses a significant threat to ecosystems, human settlements, and air quality due to the rapid spread of wildfires. This study aims to advance our understanding of dry lightning and its associated meteorological conditions, wildfire ignitions, air quality impacts, and future projections.
