The catalytic mechanism of Fe-MOF-C was investigated through various experiments. Kinetic analysis demonstrated that over 90% of the target was removed by •OH in the Fe-MOF-C/O3 system. AcOH control experiments revealed a positive correlation between •OH and H2O2, while H2O2 decomposition experiments indicated that only the coexistence of ozone and Fe-MOF-C facilitated H2O2 decomposition.
