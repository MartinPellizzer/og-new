The results suggest that non-thermal plasma technology is an effective method for desulfurizing fuel without the need for high temperatures or pressures. The use of ozone generation and acetonitrile extraction enables efficient removal of sulfur compounds, resulting in a significant reduction in sulfur content. These findings have implications for the development of new methods for fuel treatment and processing.
