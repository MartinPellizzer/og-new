Here are five detailed paragraphs based on the scientific study:

**Paragraph 1**
The degradation of emerging persistent organic pollutants (POPs) such as 2-(2H-benzotriazol-2-yl)-4,6-di-tert-pentylphenol (UV328) is a significant environmental concern due to their ubiquity in environmental matrices and potential ecological risks. Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) have been tested for the degradation of UV328, but the mechanisms underlying these processes remain poorly understood. This study aims to investigate the degradation performance and mechanisms of UV328 by an ozone (O3) and peroxymonosulfate (PMS) system.

**Paragraph 2**
The experimental methods employed in this study involve a batch reactor system where O3 gas was generated using a commercial ozone generator, and PMS solution was prepared according to the literature. The reaction mixture consisted of UV328 (20 mg/L), O3 (6.4 mg/min), and PMS (2 mM) at neutral pH (7.0). The degradation kinetics were monitored spectrophotometrically at 320 nm.

**Paragraph 3**
The results showed that 97.0% of UV328 was removed in 5 minutes with the O3/PMS system, indicating efficient degradation performance. The degradation rate was positively correlated with the concentration of oxidants (O3 and PMS). Furthermore, hydroxyl radical (•OH), sulfate radical (SO4•-), and singlet oxygen (1O2) were identified as reactive species participating in UV328 degradation.

**Paragraph 4**
The degradation mechanisms of UV328 by O3/PMS were investigated using density functional theory simulations. Three pathways, namely dehydrogenation, cycloaddition, and hydroxylation, were proposed based on the transformation intermediates. •OH and SO4•- radicals could attack UV328 through hydrogen atom abstraction channels. 1O2-mediated cycloaddition reactions were also found to be favorable.

**Paragraph 5**
The toxicity assessment results indicated that O3/PMS treatment effectively mitigated the ecological risks of UV328. This study highlights the potential of O3/PMS as a promising AOP for the degradation of POPs like UV328, and provides insights into the underlying mechanisms. Further research is needed to fully understand the effects of O3/PMS on the environment and human health.
