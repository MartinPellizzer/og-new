The catalytic activity of the Me-MOF-C materials was evaluated by quantifying the removal of target pollutants when combined with ozone. The results showed that all the Me-MOF-C materials promoted target removal compared to the MOF/O3 systems, with Fe-MOF-C being optimal due to its superior ozone utilization efficiency. ROS quantification revealed that the â€¢OH in the Fe-MOF-C/O3 system was approximately 48.0 times that of single ozone system.
