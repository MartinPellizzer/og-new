The study employed an atmospheric pressure jet-stirred reactor (JSR) to conduct the ozonolysis reactions at temperatures ranging from 320 K to 760 K. Molecular-beam mass spectrometry was used in conjunction with single-photon tunable synchrotron VUV radiation to identify elusive intermediates through experimental photoionization energy scans and ab initio threshold energy calculations for isomer identification. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were also performed at the M06-2X/AUG-cc-PVTZ level of theory to determine the locally adiabatic ionization energy of structures of interest.
