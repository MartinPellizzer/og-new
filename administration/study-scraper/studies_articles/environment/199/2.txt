The results of the study revealed diurnal variations in NO and NO2 concentrations, which increased with increasing road traffic. O3 concentrations peaked mid-day, likely influenced by solar radiation. The ozone weekend effect was also observed, where O3 levels were significantly higher on weekends compared to weekdays at stations located in urban areas. Mean O3 concentrations were found to peak in late spring, possibly attributed to various factors such as heating emissions and stratospheric ozone intrusion.
