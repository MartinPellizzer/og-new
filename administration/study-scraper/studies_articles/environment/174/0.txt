Soybean sprout is a popular ingredient in many Asian cuisines, and its quality is largely determined by its "green" color. The "green" color of soybean sprout is mainly due to the presence of chlorophyll, which plays a crucial role in photosynthesis. However, excessive growth of chlorophyll can lead to over-greening, which affects the nutritional value and sensory quality of soybean sprout. To address this issue, researchers have been exploring new methods to regulate the growth of chlorophyll in soybean sprouts. One such method is ozone micro-nano-bubbles (Ozone MNBs) treatment.
