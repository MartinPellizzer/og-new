In conclusion, this study has advanced our understanding of the reaction networks of Criegee intermediates formed in ozone-assisted oxidation reactions of alkenes. The results highlight the importance of considering alkene structure when developing kinetics models for ozonolysis reactions. The detection of ketohydroperoxide intermediates and the decomposition of long-chain CIs shed new light on the complex reaction mechanisms involved, paving the way for future studies to explore the atmospheric and combustion chemistry implications of these findings.
