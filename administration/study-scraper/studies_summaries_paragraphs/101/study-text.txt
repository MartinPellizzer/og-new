Here is a detailed summary of the study in one paragraph, focusing on information and data related to ozone:

This study presents the development and evaluation of an ozone differential absorption lidar system that can measure vertical profiles of lower tropospheric ozone with high spatiotemporal resolutions. The system uses a single CO2 Raman cell to emit three laser beams at wavelengths 276 nm, 287 nm, and 299 nm, which are then collected by a 250 mm telescope and grating spectrometer. The system is able to obtain ozone concentrations in an altitude range of 0.3-4 km, with accuracy evaluated considering aerosol interference and statistical error. For altitudes below 600 m, the wavelength pair of 276 nm-287 nm is used for inversion, while above 600 m, the pair of 287 nm-299 nm is used. The lidar system was deployed in a field campaign using a tethered balloon platform, showing good agreement with measured ozone profiles.
