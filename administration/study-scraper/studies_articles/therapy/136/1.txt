The study employed a post-test only control group design, involving 36 Sprague Dawley rats divided into six groups: one control group (C1) without intervention, one control group treated with hydrocortisone ointment (C2), and four intervention groups receiving different concentrations of ozonated Aloe vera oil (P1, P2, P3, and P4). The rats were treated topically for seven days, after which the wounds were terminated and histopathological analysis was performed to assess inflammatory and growth factors. Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS version 22.
