The results showed that the photocatalytic treatment process enabled mineralization (degradation to CO2 and mineral salts) of many known micro-pollutants. The reaction with hydroxyl radicals allowed for degradation of parent substances, but required a multiple of the treatment effort necessary for degradation alone. Organic wastewater matrices exhibited varying behaviors during photocatalytic treatment, leading to statements on transformation products and correlations to parent substance degradation.
