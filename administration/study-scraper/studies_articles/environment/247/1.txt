The methods employed in this study include data preprocessing using an isolated forest (iForest) for anomaly detection, construction of a dynamic graph sequence based on wind direction, wind speed, and station geographic location, and establishment of a spatio-temporal dynamic graph convolutional network (STD-GCN). The STD-GCN model incorporates wind field factors to improve spatial interpretability. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Graph Convolutional Embedded LSTM (GC-LSTM) were used as benchmarks for comparison.
