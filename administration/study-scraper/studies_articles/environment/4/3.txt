The discussion focuses on the synergistic effect between Cu2S and Ni3S2 in the Cu2S/Ni3S2@NF catalyst, which promotes the catalytic decomposition of ozone and enhances the removal rate of PNP. The results also highlight the importance of optimizing the reaction conditions to achieve efficient degradation.
