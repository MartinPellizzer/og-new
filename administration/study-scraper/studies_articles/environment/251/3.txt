The study highlights the importance of incorporating orography into climate models when studying exoplanet atmospheres. The results demonstrate that even small changes in model parameters can have a significant impact on atmospheric dynamics and O3 distribution. This underscores the need for careful consideration of surface features when interpreting observations of exoplanet atmospheres.
