Abstract
The consumption of seafood is driven by flavour, yet achieving its high quality remains a challenge for many species reared in recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS). A comprehensive knowledge of off-odour sources in aquatic foods is indispensable in ensuring flavour quality standards. At the beginning of the production chain, early post-harvest lipid oxidation products develop into endogenous off-odours and accumulate over time. These malodours add to those already absorbed exogenously, namely from the water and feeds, although the information on the interactions between these sources is currently scarce. Despite geosmin and 2-methylisoborneol receiving significant attention in relation to fish off-flavour, only limited knowledge on the molecular and ecological mechanisms driving their production in aquatic environments has been reported. Moreover, RAS-hosted bacteria have been associated with a wide range of other odour-active compounds, such as pyrazines, terpenoids, and other degradation byproducts that are frequently overlooked when studying flavour taint in fish. The influence of aquaculture feeds on the flavour of fish flesh has been underestimated, too, both as a source of off-odours but also as a novel modulator strategy to achieve desirable aquatic food flavours. Finally, the influence of water treatment processes widely used in RAS operations, such as advance oxidation process, ozone, ultraviolet and hydrogen peroxide disinfections, is greatly underexplored with respect to odour quality. This article reviews the current scientific evidence with supporting data on the chemical diversity of off-odours found in aquaculture fish worldwide and their potential sources and highlights knowledge gaps that should be addressed in future research.
1 INTRODUCTION
Recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) are land-based and controlled-environment farming systems, resulting from over four decades of research and development in both the private and public sectors.1, 2 The advancement of RAS technology has been accelerated by the rising environmental regulations in European countries with limited access to water.3, 4 RAS are deemed promising aquaculture technologies since they can increase the economic viability of aquaculture businesses by improving production efficiency. RAS allows the control of biotic and abiotic environmental parameters, the stabilisation of production capacities, assurance in high-quality seafood standards avoiding the influence of seasonality, and can greatly expand the opportunities to produce blue foods anywhere on land, such as close to the major food markets.1-7 Furthermore, RAS significantly reduces land and water usage, and permits the upcycling of waste streams into nitrogen- and phosphorous-rich fertilisers.3, 4 As food production systems, RAS are potentially devoid of environmental pollutants, independent of site, salinity, and species restrictions, and are bio-secure.7 Overall, when compared to other fisheries, RAS can produce the highest yield per unit area with the smallest environmental footprint, largely depending on aquaculture feeds and non-renewable energy consumption.1, 3, 4, 7
Despite their productive advantages, RAS are associated with high technological complexity. The success of RAS operators relies on their ability to closely monitor and understand the individual system parameters, from physical to chemical and biological.1 Hence, this multidisciplinary technology requires advanced competences in aquatic biology and microbiology, as well as environmental, electrochemical and process engineering. Additionally, commercial-scale RAS operations require substantial capital investment and high energy consumption rates, which have limited their development and implementation to wealthy nations.5, 8-10 As a result, successful RAS businesses are currently scarce, with most being hatcheries and Atlantic salmon pre-smolt rearing facilities, which operate before the animals are moved to sea cages.5
Bacterial biofilms easily develop in RAS systems. During the continuous water circulation, bacteria encounter numerous surfaces, for example, in the mechanical and biological filters and other water treatment units. After settling on a surface, many species of bacteria produce extracellular material that forms a slimy biofilm, ensuring surface adhesion, protection from harmful water-borne compounds and nutrient trapping.11 Since most RAS systems use natural freshwater or seawater in the production tanks, naturally occurring bacteria colonise the water, despite various in-take water treatment systems. Species that produce earthy- and musty-smelling volatile compounds also thrive among such bacteria.12, 13 Their presence and production of volatiles, in combination with the water recirculation within the system, leads to an accumulation of these odours compounds in the water, from where they are readily absorbed into fish flesh.14 The tainting of RAS fish with these malodours—referred to as off-odour or off-flavour—is considered one of the main challenges of RAS production worldwide, as it leads to consumer rejection and consequently a significant reduction in the marketability of the fish, leading to a negative economic impact on RAS farms.15, 16 Moreover, the prevalence of such odours in cultured fish has created a socio-cultural discredit of these products over the last decades that continues to negatively impacts the development of the sector.17
Given the urgency of the issue and the lack of exhaustive information, this review attempts to compile the existing scientific knowledge on off-flavour in aquaculture-reared fish, with a special emphasis on perception qualities, chemical diversity, and provenance. This article reviews an extensive collection of literature available on odour and off-odour sources in aquaculture and sets out to unravel the current knowledge gaps on aquaculture aquatic food flavour, although the state-of-the-art with respect to sensory-analytical techniques used to study aquatic food odour is not addressed here. A comprehensive overview of chemical classes and subclasses, sensory-relevant physicochemical data, and specific aquatic species or aquaculture-related products wherein most of the off-odours addressed here have been reported, is provided in Table 1.
