Here is a detailed summary of the study in one paragraph, focusing on the information and data related to ozone:

The reaction between 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB) and ozone was studied using Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS). The FTIR spectra showed new vibrational absorptions containing C=O and O-H functional groups after ozone passes through DCB, with peak intensities increasing with reaction time. The IR spectrum of the brown precipitate formed at the end of the reaction revealed distinct new peaks corresponding to bending vibration mode of C=C-H, stretching vibration mode of C=C, C=O stretching vibration mode, and -OH stretching mode. GC/MS analysis detected high molecular weight products after dissolving the precipitate in different solvents, suggesting a possible polymerization reaction. The study demonstrates the effective destruction and decomposition of DCB by ozone, with potential applications in environmental pollution control and wastewater treatment.
