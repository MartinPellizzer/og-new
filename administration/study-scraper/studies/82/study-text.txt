Abstract
Gas sensors based on ambipolar materials offer significant advantages in reducing the size of the analytical system and enhancing its efficiency. Here, bilayer heterojunction devices are constructed using different octafluorinated phthalocyanine complexes, with Zn and Co as metal centers, combined with a lutetium bisphthalocyanine complex (LuPc2). Stable p-type behavior is observed for the ZnF8Pc/LuPc2 device under both electron-donating (NH3) and -oxidizing (NO2 and O3) gaseous species, while the CoF8Pc/LuPc2 device exhibits n-type behavior under reducing gases and p-type behavior under oxidizing gases. The nature of majority of the charge carriers of Co-based devices varies depending on the nature of target gases, displaying an ambipolar behavior. Both heterojunction devices demonstrate stable and observable response toward all three toxic gases in the sub-ppm range. Remarkably, the Co-based device is highly sensitive toward ammonia with a limit of detection (LOD) of 200 ppb, whereas the Zn-based device demonstrates exceptional sensitivity toward oxidizing gases, with excellent LOD values of 4.9 and 0.75 ppb toward NO2 and O3, respectively, which makes it one of the most effective organic heterojunction sensors reported so far for oxidizing gases.
Keywords: ammonia; environment; gas sensors; molecular semiconductors; nitrogen dioxide; ozone.
