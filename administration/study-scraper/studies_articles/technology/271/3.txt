The discussion highlights the importance of considering toxicity as a variable in wastewater treatment assessments. Although electrocoagulation and ozonation can effectively remove pollutants, they may also generate recalcitrant and toxic compounds during treatment processes. This incomplete removal of pollutant load contributes to the persistence of acute toxicity in treated effluents.
