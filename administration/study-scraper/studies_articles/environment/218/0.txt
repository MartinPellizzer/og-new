The Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO) is a complex phenomenon that affects stratospheric ozone throughout the atmosphere. The QBO is characterized by changes in tropical winds, which in turn impact transport of ozone and other trace gases, as well as temperature changes that alter chemical processes. Understanding the interplay between these factors is crucial for predicting the effects of climate change on stratospheric ozone. This study aims to disentangle the chemistry and transport impacts of the QBO on stratospheric ozone using a state-of-the-art climate model and linearized stratospheric ozone chemistry.
