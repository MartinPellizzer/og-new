In conclusion, this study demonstrates the effective degradation of UV328 by the O3/PMS system and provides insight into the involved reaction mechanisms. The findings highlight the importance of understanding the roles of reactive species in pollutant degradation and have implications for the development of efficient technologies for removing emerging pollutants from environmental matrices. Future studies can build upon these results to optimize O3/PMS systems for UV328 removal and explore their applicability to other organic pollutants.
