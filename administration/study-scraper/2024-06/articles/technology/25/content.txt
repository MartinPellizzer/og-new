Here are five detailed paragraphs based on the scientific study:

**Paragraph 1**
The two-spotted spider mite (Tetranychus urticae) is a significant threat to greenhouse strawberry production. The application of synthetic acaricides is the primary method of controlling T. urticae, but resistance development reduces their efficacy and eventually leads to control failure. Therefore, it is crucial for strawberry growers to seek new acaricides and application technologies that can limit the harm caused by T. urticae in environmentally friendly ways. In this study, laboratory toxicity tests and field trials were conducted to screen high-efficiency acaricides and optimize application technologies to manage T. urticae.

**Paragraph 2**
The laboratory toxicity tests used nine acaricides against adult and egg stages of T. urticae. The results showed that cyetpyrafen had the highest efficacy, with an LC50 value of 0.226 mg/L against adult T. urticae and 0.082 mg/L against eggs. Field trials were conducted to confirm the control effects of five acaricides, including cyetpyrafen, cyenopyrafen, cyflumetofen, bifenazate, and etoxazole. The experiments were designed as randomized complete block designs with four replicates.

**Paragraph 3**
The results showed that the best treatment was cyetpyrafen at 300 mL/ha, which had a control effect of 83.77% against T. urticae one day after treatment (DAT). Cyenopyrafen and cyflumetofen were also effective in controlling T. urticae, with control effects of 81.99% and 81.57%, respectively. The control effects of the other treatments were lower. At three DAT, cyetpyrafen still had the best control effect, followed by cyenopyrafen and cyflumetofen.

**Paragraph 4**
The study suggests that increasing the spray volume and using ozone spray can improve T. urticae management. The results showed that increasing the spray volume from 900 to 1050 L/ha significantly improved the control of T. urticae, while the control effects of the other spray volumes were lower. Similarly, the control effects on T. urticae in ozone spray treatments were higher than those of conventional and electrostatic sprays.

**Paragraph 5**
In conclusion, this study demonstrated that cyetpyrafen is an effective acaricide for controlling T. urticae in strawberries. Increasing the spray volume and using ozone spray can also improve T. urticae management. The results provide valuable information for strawberry growers to optimize their management strategies against T. urticae sustainably in field conditions.
