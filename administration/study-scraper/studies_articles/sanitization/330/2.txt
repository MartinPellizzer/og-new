The results showed that combined chlorination and ozonation was the most effective method for inactivating planktonic Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with a significant reduction in cell viability within 10 minutes. Microfluidic chip culture revealed that the secretion of quinolone signals escalated biofilm disinfection resistance. Disinfection exposure significantly altered gene expression in both wild-type strains and QS signaling-deficient mutants.
