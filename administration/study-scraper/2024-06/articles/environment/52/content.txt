Here are five paragraphs summarizing the scientific study:

**Paragraph 1**
Ozone pollution is a significant environmental issue in many cities around the world. Lhasa, a high-altitude city on the Tibetan Plateau, is particularly susceptible to ozone pollution due to its unique climate and geography. Understanding the intricacies of ozone formation in Lhasa is crucial for developing effective control strategies. This study aims to investigate the sensitivity of ozone production in Lhasa by comparing direct ozone production rate measurements with findings from Beijing under similar climatic conditions.

**Paragraph 2**
The study employed a twin-chamber system to measure direct ozone production rates in Lhasa in June 2021. The measurement was compared to data from Beijing in similar climatic conditions. The researchers also analyzed the diel variation of volatile organic compound-ketene hydroperoxide (VOC-kOH) and nitric oxide (NOx) levels to better understand the complex interactions involved in ozone formation.

**Paragraph 3**
The results showed that Lhasa exhibited a higher direct ozone production rate with reduced variations compared to Beijing, despite lower NOx levels. The diel variation of VOC-kOH was observed to be unique in Lhasa, favoring daytime peroxy radical production and pushing the NO turning point higher from morning to noon. The study also found that the accumulation of oxidized volatile organic compounds (OVOCs) in the Lhasa River valley contributed to elevated VOC-kOH levels.

**Paragraph 4**
The findings highlight the complex and sensitive nature of ozone pollution in Lhasa and other Tibetan Plateau cities. The diel variation of VOC-kOH and NOx levels plays a crucial role in determining the sensitivity of ozone production to precursor emissions. The study suggests that future increases in volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions could worsen ozone pollution, potentially triggered by factors such as rapid warming and local afforestation initiatives.

**Paragraph 5**
In conclusion, this study provides valuable insights into the intricacies of ozone formation in Lhasa and underscores the importance of considering the unique climatic and geographical characteristics of high-altitude cities when developing control strategies. Further research is necessary to fully understand the complex interactions involved in ozone pollution and to develop effective mitigation measures for this critical environmental issue.
