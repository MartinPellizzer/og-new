Abstract
Introduction: 
This study aimed to evaluate and compare postoperative pain (PP) in single-visit nonsurgical endodontic retreatment (SV NSER) with 2% chlorhexidine (CHX), 0.1% octenidine (OCT) with or without ozone, and 5.25% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl).
Materials and Methods: 
In this randomized, parallel, prospective, double-blind, clinical trial, 132 single-rooted, root-filled teeth with symptomatic apical periodontitis (AP) requiring NSER were allocated into six groups randomly (n = 22/group): 2% CHX with NaOCl (CHXH), 2% Ozonated CHX without NaOCl (OCHX), 2% Ozonated CHX with NaOCl (OCHXH), 0.1% OCT with NaOCl (OCTH), 0.1% Ozonated OCT without NaOCl (OOCT), and 0.1% Ozonated OCT with NaOCl (OOCTH). Standard NSER protocol was followed groups were irrigated with 15 ml of ozonated or nonozonated irrigant (CHX/OCT) for 3–5 min with ultrasonic agitation. PP at baseline, after 6, 12, 24, 48 h, and 7 days was recorded using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Logistic regression of predictor variables was compared using the Chi-square test. For group-wise and time-wise comparisons, a two-way analysis of variance followed by the post hoc Bonferroni test was carried out.
Results: 
None of the patient-related variables in logistic regression obtained a statistically significant (P > 0.05) role in PP. The VAS score after 6 h was OCHX (4.72) > OOCT (4.42) > CHXH (4.23) > OCTH (3.95) > OCHXH (3.42) > OOCTH (3.21). OOCTH and OCHXH groups demonstrated statistically significant reductions in VAS scores at various time intervals (P < 0.05).
Conclusion: 
SV NSER with ozonated OCT, CHX irrigation, and NaOCl resulted in lesser PP at all time intervals, i.e., 6, 12, 24, 48 h, and 7 days in patients with symptomatic AP.
INTRODUCTION
Substantial advancement has occurred in contemporary endodontics concerning disinfection of radicular spaces, but root canal reinfections and their associated apical periodontitis (AP) lesions are remarkably prevalent. Fifty-six percent of adults globally have undergone at least one endodontic treatment, yet 24%–65% of these teeth remain associated with persistent AP.[1,2] Furthermore, there has been an increase in the occurrence of AP from 35% to 41% in endodontically treated teeth worldwide from 2012 to 2020.[3] Prevention of further rise in these cases would require a significant improvement in endodontic treatment.
Our understanding of AP in failed cases points toward the cumulative pathogenicity of the multi-species microbial community. These act as a unit in biofilm adhering to anatomical complexities contributing to refractory infection and postoperative pain (PP).[4] Clinical strategies focus on “canal shaping” to radiographically impeccable levels rather than the critical aspect of “chemomechanical disinfection,” which prevents reinfection. Irrigation plays a primary role in removing pulp tissue, reducing the microbial load to a subcritical level, resolving periapical disease, and helping healing.[5]
Sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) is the gold-standard endodontic irrigant because of its antibacterial properties, lubricant action, and high tissue dissolution. However, its inadequacies include its cytotoxicity, high surface tension, and reduced antibacterial potential on mature biofilms (>3 weeks old) in the presence of organic tissue.[6,7]
Chlorhexidine (CHX) is the irrigant of choice in retreatment cases due to its substantivity and bactericidal action against resistant microorganisms (effectively reduces bacteria by 99.61% and endotoxin by 60.6%).[8] However, poor tissue dissolution, limited action on Gram-negative bacteria, and cytotoxicity limit its usage as a stand-alone irrigant.[9,10] Since no single irrigant is ideal, a need for an optimal multi-irrigant regimen that predictably achieves safe and efficacious irrigation is needed.
Octenidine (OCT) dihydrochloride is an emerging irrigant with broad-spectrum activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, chlamydia, and fungi.[11,12] It is unique owing to its noncytotoxic nature and microbicidal efficacy, which is ten times greater than CHX. OCT can be an alternative irrigant, but the lack of in vivo studies has prevented its widespread usage.[13]
Ozone is a potent and selective oxidant that rapidly dissociates into water and releases a reactive form of oxygen that oxidizes cells, hence having antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory efficacy with low cytotoxicity and high biocompatibility with oral tissues.[14] The antimicrobial effect of a single ozone molecule is equivalent to 3000–10000 chlorine molecules, thereby acting around 3500 times faster. Owing to these properties, this novel technique of ozonation of irrigants attempts to assess its efficacy in combination with other irrigants. This randomized, parallel, prospective, double-blind clinical trial evaluated and compared PP after nonsurgical endodontic retreatment (NSER) using ozonated or nonozonated, 0.1% OCT, and 2% CHX with or without 5.25% NaOCl application in teeth with posttreatment AP.
Objectives
The primary objective was to evaluate and compare PP in single-visit (SV) NSER following ozonated or nonozonated irrigation with CHX or OCT. The secondary objective was to assess the effect of NaOCl and ozonated CHX, OCT on PP at baseline, 6, 12, 24, 48 h, and 7 days.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Ethics and reporting guidelines
Prior approval (PDCH/21/EC-286) from the research ethical committee was procured. Signed informed consent of all the participants was obtained after discussing alternative treatment options and the pros and cons associated with the procedure. During the trial Preferred Reporting Items for Randomized Trial in Endodontics 2020 guidelines (Nagendrababu et al. 2020) were followed.[15]
Selection of subjects
The study was conducted from February 2022 to March 2023, and it included patients requiring NSER reporting to the Department of Conservative Dentistry and Endodontics, XXX Dental College and Hospital. It was registered in the Clinical Trials Registry, India (CTRI/2022/02/040315).
Sample size determination
A pilot study was conducted on 48 subjects among the six groups (eight subjects per group) to estimate the sample size using G Power (version 3.19.7) software. Based on the mean and pooled standard deviation, effect size F was 0.32. The sample size was estimated as 132 (22 subjects per group) at a 95% confidence interval (CI) with a power of 80%.
Inclusion criteria
Patients with single-rooted, root-filled teeth with persistent AP (symptomatic teeth) requiring NSER with radiographic evidence of previous endodontic treatment done >3 years ago, sufficient coronal tooth structure for adequate isolation with a rubber dam, gutta-percha (GP) material within 4–7 mm of the radiographic apex and no exposure of obturating material to the oral cavity.
Exclusion criteria
Patients who were medically compromised, allergic to the local anesthetic agent, irrigants, and ozone, with a recent history of myocardial infarction, acute alcohol intoxication, active bleeding, uncontrolled hyperthyroidism, thrombocytopenia, and glucose six phosphatase deficiency.
Patients under 18 years, with swelling, acute apical abscess, antibiotic, corticosteroid, anti-inflammatory, analgesic medication taken within 7 days before treatment, multiple teeth (to eliminate the possibility of pain referral), periodontal pocket >4 mm, and intraradicular posts were excluded from the study.
Subject allocation and randomization
A secondary investigator not involved in the trial assessed the eligibility of patients, based on their medical and dental history; and clinical and radiographic assessment for random allocation. To ensure randomization and allocation concealment, patients picked a computer generated, randomly sequenced, sealed opaque envelope with a unique five-digit code (containing group information). Patients were randomly allocated into groups (allocation ratio 5:1)-
Group 1 – 2% CHX (Chlor X, Prevest DenPro Ltd., Jammu, India) with 5.25% NaOCl (CHXH) (Control Group)
Group 2 – 2% Ozonated CHX (OCHX)
Group 3 – 2% Ozonated CHX with 5.25% NaOCl (OCHXH)
Group 4 – 0.1% OCT (Octenisept, Norderstedt, Germany) with 5.25% NaOCl (OCTH)
Group 5 – 0.1% Ozonated OCT (OOCT)
Group 6 – 0.1% Ozonated OCT with 5.25% NaOCl (OOCTH).
Only the secondary investigator was aware of the allocated group of patients and provided operator irrigants according to the group with opaque labels. However, complete blinding was impossible because of hypochlorite and ozone odor. Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scale was employed to assess pain at baseline, 6, 12, 24, 48 h, and 7 days. A sole operator with more than 15 years of experience performed retreatment of all the patients following standard and uniform treatment protocol. The group information was kept confidential during the data collection period to ensure the blinding of the patient and investigator. On study completion, a blinded assessor and statistician filled the master chart with the VAS scores of each patient and analyzed the data without identifying their actual group.
Non-surgical endodontic retreatment procedure
One hundred and eighty-seven patients requiring NSER were assessed based on eligibility criteria, of which 43 did not meet inclusion criteria, and 12 were unwilling to participate in the trial. Hundred and thirty-two patients were enrolled and randomly divided into six groups [Figure 1]. NSER followed contemporary standard protocol. Each patient was anesthetized using 2% Lidocaine with 80,000 adrenaline (Lignox, Indoco, Warren, Mumbai, India) followed by rubber dam isolation. Previous coronal restorations and GP were removed using rotary retreatment files (ProTaper Universal, Dentsply Maillefer), following manufacturer instructions. Hedstrom, K-files were used to retrieve apical GP with copious irrigation with a 27-G side vented needle (Densply. Tulsa, OK) (Group 1-CHX, Group 2 and 3-OCHX, Group 4-OCT, Group 5 and 6-OOCT) but without chemical solvents. CHXH, OCHXH, OCTH, and OOCTH groups were irrigated with 5.25% NaOCl after 10 ml saline irrigation to remove residues of NaOCl and prevent the formation of para-chloroaniline (with CHX in CHX, OCHX groups).[16,17] CHX and OCT groups were irrigated with 2% CHX and 0.1% OCT, respectively. Working length (WL) was determined using an apex locater (Root ZX mini, J Morita Corp, Tokyo, Japan). Root canal cleanliness (removal of GP) and WL were confirmed with intraoral periapical radiographs. This was followed by apical patency, glide path creation, and cleaning and shaping (crown-down technique). Apical preparation ranged from # 35 to # 60 based on the initial apical gauging. After completion of instrumentation, canals were irrigated with saline and dried with paper points to prevent adverse interaction between irrigants before final irrigation with CHX and OCT. Ozonated CHX, OCT was obtained by bubbling ozone in a gaseous state (4 mg/ml) in 2% CHX and 0.1% OCT for 15 min using an ozone generator (Dentozone, Analytical and medical tech. Mumbai, Maharashtra). Fifteen milliliters of ozonated CHX, OCT (based on the group) were delivered for 3–5 min, keeping the syringe tip two mm short of WL. All the irrigants were ultrasonically activated at the power setting three, with file ISO size #10 (Satelec Acteon Group, Merignac Cedex, France) following three cycles of 20 s each. Obturation and core build-up were completed in the same appointment, but no postoperative analgesics were advised to the patients. In case of severe pain, a backup phone number and a reserve analgesic ibuprofen; and if there was an emergency or if the pain did not respond to analgesics; reporting back was suggested. Patients who took the reserve medication within 7 days of treatment were excluded from the study.

Postendodontic pain assessment
The VAS scale used for pain assessment consisted of a 10-cm line anchored by two extremes with “no pain” at the start and “pain as bad as it could be” at the end. PP levels at baseline, after 6, 12, 24, 48 h, and 7 days post-treatment, were recorded by patients based on their pain perception. Patients were reminded to fill in the VAS scores at stated time intervals with reminder phone calls.
Follow-up and outcome assessments
Patients were recalled for follow-up after 1 week, for their clinical evaluation and pain diary collection. The recorded pain levels were tabulated and subjected to statistical analysis.
Statistical analysis
After data collection, it was coded and entered into Microsoft Excel 2019. Descriptive analysis was presented as mean and standard deviation. Due to the normal distribution of data, parametric tests were employed to compare the means. Two-way analysis of variance was used to compare mean differences among the groups and at various time intervals, followed by a post hoc Bonferroni test. For statistical analysis, Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS version 22, IBM cooperation, Armonk, NY, USA) was used, with a 5% level of significance.
Logistic regression of demographic data was presented as a proportion [Tables 1 and 2] and compared using the Chi-square test. Relationship between predictors variables such as age groups, gender (male/female), tooth (incisors/canine/premolars), arch (maxillary/mandibular), pain during previous treatment (yes/no),
