The findings suggest that catalytic ozonation is an effective method for treating Fluoxetine-containing wastewater. The reaction time, catalyst amount, and initial ozone concentration were identified as key operational parameters affecting COD removal. The optimized process conditions obtained in this study can be used as a reference point for further research and industrial applications.
