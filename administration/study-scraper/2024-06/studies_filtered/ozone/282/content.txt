Key Points
Question  Is there an association between climate change–related environmental stressors and cardiovascular health outcomes?
Findings  In this systematic review of 492 observational studies, exposure to climate change–related environmental stressors like extreme temperature and hurricanes was associated with increased morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease, while increased risk after exposure to wildfire smoke was less certain. Older adults, individuals from racial and ethnic minoritized groups, and lower-wealth communities were disproportionately affected, while data on outcomes in low-income countries were lacking.
Meaning  Urgent action is needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and lower climate change–associated cardiovascular risk in vulnerable populations.
Abstract
Importance  Climate change may increase the risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes by causing direct physiologic changes, psychological distress, and disruption of health-related infrastructure. Yet, the association between numerous climate change–related environmental stressors and the incidence of adverse cardiovascular events has not been systematically reviewed.
Objective  To review the current evidence on the association between climate change–related environmental stressors and adverse cardiovascular outcomes.
Evidence Review  PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library were searched to identify peer-reviewed publications from January 1, 1970, through November 15, 2023, that evaluated associations between environmental exposures and cardiovascular mortality, acute cardiovascular events, and related health care utilization. Studies that examined only nonwildfire-sourced particulate air pollution were excluded. Two investigators independently screened 20 798 articles and selected 2564 for full-text review. Study quality was assessed using the Navigation Guide framework. Findings were qualitatively synthesized as substantial differences in study design precluded quantitative meta-analysis.
Findings  Of 492 observational studies that met inclusion criteria, 182 examined extreme temperature, 210 ground-level ozone, 45 wildfire smoke, and 63 extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, dust storms, and droughts. These studies presented findings from 30 high-income countries, 17 middle-income countries, and 1 low-income country. The strength of evidence was rated as sufficient for extreme temperature; ground-level ozone; tropical storms, hurricanes, and cyclones; and dust storms. Evidence was limited for wildfire smoke and inadequate for drought and mudslides. Exposure to extreme temperature was associated with increased cardiovascular mortality and morbidity, but the magnitude varied with temperature and duration of exposure. Ground-level ozone amplified the risk associated with higher temperatures and vice versa. Extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, were associated with increased cardiovascular risk that persisted for many months after the initial event. Some studies noted a small increase in cardiovascular mortality, out-of-hospital cardiac arrests, and hospitalizations for ischemic heart disease after exposure to wildfire smoke, while others found no association. Older adults, racial and ethnic minoritized populations, and lower-wealth communities were disproportionately affected.
Conclusions and Relevance  Several environmental stressors that are predicted to increase in frequency and intensity with climate change are associated with increased cardiovascular risk, but data on outcomes in low-income countries are lacking. Urgent action is needed to mitigate climate change–associated cardiovascular risk, particularly in vulnerable populations.
