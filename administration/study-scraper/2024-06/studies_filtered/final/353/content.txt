Abstract
While air pollution poses a major threat to environmental health, monitoring and understanding this problem is extremely important. Especially in industrial areas, it is a vital requirement to monitor the levels of pollutants such as Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), Sulphur Dioxide (SO2), Ozone (O3), Formaldehyde (HCHO) and Carbon Monoxide (CO) in the atmosphere. This situation becomes even more critical in areas such as Zonguldak where industrial activities are intense. In this study, the Sentinel-5P TROPOMI satellite and Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform were used to determine the air quality values in Zonguldak province. The study extracted data using coding method to determine the values of pollutants such as NO2, SO2, O3, HCHO and CO in the atmosphere between 2020 and-2022. Coding was performed using satellite data on the GEE platform and thematic maps and graphs were created with the data obtained. According to the results obtained, it was observed that air pollution is intense especially in Ereğli district and Filyos town. Such analyses are extremely important in terms of understanding the pollution levels in certain regions and evaluating their possible environmental impacts. These findings can provide important clues for taking protective measures for environmental health and reducing the effects of industrial activities on the environment.
