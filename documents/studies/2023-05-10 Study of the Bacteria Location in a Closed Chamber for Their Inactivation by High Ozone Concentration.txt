---------------------------------------------------

problem:
	sterilization inside an aluminum enclosure

experiment:
	ceramic plates ozone generator
	2000 ppm
	1 min
	2 step sanitization for best results:
		1. sanitization 3 mins
		2. destruction with 60 Â°C 20 mins 
	Escherichia coli ATCC25922, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25,923, Bacillus cereus ATCC 11,778,
		Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC27853, and Candida albicans ATCC1023
	10^6 CFU/ml

result:
	sterilization rate greater than 99.99% for the five different species of bacterium
	better efficacy against E. coli due to its thinner cell surface structure
	after only 60 s of ozonation, a fungal disappearance was clearly observed
		

objective:
	gaseous ozone produced inside with a high concentration (2000 ppm/min)
		eliminates the various bacteria and fungi studied in a short time
	Ozonation appears to be a good alternative for the sterilization of medical-surgical devices.
