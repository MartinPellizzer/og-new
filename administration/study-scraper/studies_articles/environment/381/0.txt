The study of the complex interaction between ozone and the autoxidation of 1-hexene is crucial for understanding the chemistry of atmospheric and combustion regimes. The reaction is known to produce highly oxygenated organic molecules, which play a significant role in the formation of secondary organic aerosols and affect air quality. To investigate this process, researchers have employed synchrotron-based photoelectron spectroscopy and chemical ionization mass spectrometry to analyze the products formed during the ozonolysis of 1-hexene over a wide temperature range.
