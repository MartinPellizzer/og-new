In conclusion, the implementation of ozone/BAC pretreatment as part of a membrane-based advanced treatment train can provide significant benefits for direct potable reuse projects. The improved water quality and reduced operating pressures and chemical use achieved through ozone/BAC pretreatment can lead to cost savings and increased public health protection. The study's findings support the economic viability of ozone/BAC-based DPR treatment trains, making them a viable option for large-scale potable reuse projects in California and beyond.
