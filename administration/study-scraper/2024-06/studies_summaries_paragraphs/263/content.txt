Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the study, focusing on the information and data related to ozone:

This study investigated the photocatalytic ozonation process for effective removal of Acid Blue 113 dye from wastewater using a three-component nanocomposite Fe2O3/MgO/MoS2 catalyst. The results showed that time, pH, and amount of the catalyst are critical parameters influencing dye removal, with optimal conditions found to be pH 2.27, 8.6 mg of catalyst, ozone concentration of 0.2 mg/L-h, and reaction time of 26 min. Under these conditions, the proposed process achieved a high dye removal efficiency of 99.3%. Additionally, the nanocatalyst demonstrated excellent reusability and stability, maintaining 92% activity after eight consecutive cycles.
