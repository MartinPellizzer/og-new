Experimental results demonstrated that the integrated system significantly improved pollutant removal rates compared to traditional AOPs. The photocatalytic process with magnetic nanocomposites showed enhanced degradation of micropollutants under UV light exposure. Notably, the TiO2-based reactor exhibited superior performance in removing pollutants, with efficiencies exceeding 90%. Additionally, the results indicated that operating conditions such as pH, temperature, and catalyst loading had a significant impact on reaction outcomes.
