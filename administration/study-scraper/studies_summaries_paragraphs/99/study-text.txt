Here is a summarized paragraph focusing on the information and data related to ozone:

This study examines the relationship between solar activity, geomagnetic indices, and polar ozone under the influence of solar radiation. The analysis reveals a close connection between the geomagnetic index Ap, total ozone content, and COVID-19 incidence worldwide from January 2020 to May 2021. During this period, sudden stratospheric warmings occurred, which were analyzed using statistical methods. The study shows that changes in polar ozone are influenced by solar activity, with a notable increase in ozone levels observed during periods of high solar radiation. Specifically, the analysis found that the total ozone content increased significantly during the first and second waves of COVID-19, coinciding with peak solar activity. This suggests that the Velkhover-Chizhevsky phenomenon plays a role in vertical solar-terrestrial connections, highlighting the importance of considering solar activity when studying atmospheric phenomena such as ozone changes.
