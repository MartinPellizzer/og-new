Abstract
This paper studies a Bayesian local influence method to detect influential observations in a partially linear model with first-order autoregressive skew-normal errors. This method appears suitable for small or moderate-sized data sets (n=200{\sim }400) and overcomes some theoretical limitations, bridging the diagnostic gap for small or moderate-sized data in classical methods. The MCMC algorithm is employed for parameter estimation, and Bayesian local influence analysis is made using three perturbation schemes (priors, variances, and data) and three measurement scales (Bayes factor, \phi -divergence, and posterior mean). Simulation studies are conducted to validate the reliability of the diagnostics. Finally, a practical application uses data on the 1976 Los Angeles ozone concentration to further demonstrate the effectiveness of the diagnostics.

1.1 A1: Deviation of model reduction
Proof
By Lemma 2, model (3) can be further expressed as:
\begin{aligned} \begin{aligned} y_i&={{\textbf{x}}_i}^\top \varvec{\beta }+g(t_i)+\rho (y_{i-1}-{{\textbf{x}}_{i-1}}^\top \varvec{\beta }-g(t_{i-1}))+e_i,\\ e_i&=-\sqrt{2/\pi }\lambda +\lambda \left| h_{0i}\right| +\sigma h_{1i}, i=1,2,3\ldots n. \end{aligned} \end{aligned} (9)
In model (9), h_{0i} and h_{1i} are mutually independent standard normal random variables. Let h_i = \left| h_{0i}\right| and \eta _i = \sigma h_{1i}. Then, we can further simplify the model to:
\begin{aligned} y_i&={\bf{x}_i}^\top \varvec{\beta }+g(t_i)+\rho (y_{i-1}-{\bf{x}}_{i-1}^\top \varvec{\beta }-g(t_{i-1}))-\sqrt{2/\pi }\lambda +\lambda h_i+\eta _i, \\ \eta _i&{\mathop {\sim }\limits ^{iid}} N(0,\sigma ^2), i=1,2,3\ldots n.\\ \end{aligned} (10)
Ruppert et al. (2003) addressed the semiparametric modeling problem by demonstrating the equivalence of penalized splines and additive mixed models. In this paper, similar to Ruppert, we aim to use the low-rank thin-plate spline to represent the non-parametric part of the model in a different manner. We will expand the smooth function g(t) as follows:
\begin{aligned} g(t)=\alpha _0+\alpha _1t+\sum _{s=1}^Ku_s|t-\kappa _s|^3, \end{aligned} (11)
where t_{min}\le \kappa _1\le \kappa _2\ldots \le \kappa _K\le t_{max}, and they are fixed knots. In spline expansion, the selection of knots is crucial. Typically, these knots are determined as the sample quantiles of the covariate t’s corresponding to probability k/(K+1), where K is the number of knots. Having too many or too few knots can lead to poor spline estimation. In this paper, we adopt the knots selection method proposed by Ruppert et al. (2003) and choose 20 knots (K=20) for the spline expansion of the non-parametric part. After a series of matrix transformations (Crainiceanu et al. 2005), we can express Eq. (7) in the following form:
\begin{aligned} \varvec{g(t)}&=\varvec{T}\varvec{\alpha }+\varvec{Z}_K{\varvec{u}}\\&=\varvec{T}\varvec{\alpha }+(\varvec{Z}_K{\varvec{\Omega }_K}^{-\frac{1}{2}})({\varvec{\Omega }_K}^{\frac{1}{2}}{\varvec{u}})\\&=\varvec{T}\varvec{\alpha }+\varvec{Zb},\end{aligned}
where \varvec{g(t)}=(g(t_1),g(t_2),\ldots ,g(t_n))^\top , {\textbf{t}}=(t_1,t_2,\ldots ,t_n)^\top , \varvec{\alpha } = (\alpha _0, \alpha _1)^\top , {\varvec{T}}=({\textbf{1}}_{n\times 1},{\varvec{t}}), {\varvec{u}}=(u_1,u_2,\ldots ,u_K)^\top , {\varvec{Z}}_K is a matrix with i-th row {\varvec{Z}}_{Ki}=\{|t_i-\kappa _1|^3,\ldots ,|t_i-\kappa _K|^3\}, \varvec{\Omega }_K is a penalty coefficient matrix with k-th row \varvec{\Omega }_{Kk}=\{|\kappa _k-\kappa _1|^3,\ldots ,|\kappa _k-\kappa _K|^3\} (to avoid overfitting), {\varvec{Z}}=\varvec{Z_K\Omega }^{-\frac{1}{2}}_K, {\varvec{b}} = {\varvec{\Omega }}^{\frac{1}{2}}_K{\varvec{u}} is assumed to be normally distributed with mean zero and variance \sigma^2_b.
Then we get
\begin{aligned} Y_i&={\textbf{w}_i}^\top \varvec{\Lambda }+{\varvec{z}}_i^\top {\varvec{b}} +\rho (y_{i-1}-{\textbf{w}_{i-1}}^\top \varvec{\Lambda } -{\varvec{z}}_{i-1}{\varvec{b}})-\sqrt{2/\pi }\lambda +\lambda h_i+\eta _i, \\ \eta _i&{\mathop {\sim }\limits ^{iid}} N(0,\sigma ^2),\quad i=1,2,3\ldots n, \\ \end{aligned} (12)
which gives model (4). \square
1.2 A2: Perturbation of priors
We established perturbations of the parameters.
\begin{aligned} p(y,\varvec{\theta }|\varvec{\omega }_{p+5+20})\propto & {} \prod _{i=1}^p \varphi \Big (\frac{\beta _i-\beta _{0i}-\omega _{\beta _i}}{\sigma _{\beta _i}}\Big ) \times \varphi \Big (\frac{\alpha _0-\omega _{\alpha _0}}{\sigma _{\alpha _0}}\Big )\times \varphi \Big (\frac{\alpha _1-\omega _{\alpha _1}}{\sigma _{\alpha _1}}\Big )\times \varphi \Big (\frac{\lambda -\mu _\lambda -\omega _\lambda }{\sigma _{\lambda }}\Big )\\\times & {} \frac{1}{B(a_\rho {}_0+\omega _\rho {}_0,b_\rho {}_0)}\,\rho _0^{a_\rho {}_0+\omega _\rho {}_0-1}\,(1-\rho _0)^{b_\rho {}_0-1}\\\times & {} \frac{(\frac{1}{2}q_1+\omega _{\sigma ^2})^{\frac{1}{2}q_0}}{\Gamma (\frac{1}{2}q_0)}\,\sigma ^{-q_0-2}\, \exp \Big \{-\frac{q_1+\omega _{\sigma ^2}}{2\sigma ^2}\Big \}\times \prod _{j=1}^{20} \varphi \Big (\frac{b_j-\omega _{b_j}}{\sigma _{bj}}\Big ), \end{aligned}
where \varvec{\omega }_{p+5+20}=(\omega _{\varvec{\beta }},\omega _{\varvec{\alpha }},\omega _\lambda ,\omega _\rho ,\omega_{\sigma^2},\omega _{\textbf{b}}), and \varvec{\omega }_{p+5+20}^0={\textbf{0}} represents the scenario without any perturbation, B(\cdot ) means beta function, \Gamma (\cdot ) means gamma function. The perturbation model {\mathcal {M}}=\{p(y,\varvec{\theta }|\varvec{\omega }):\varvec{\omega }\in R^{p+5+20}\} yields a Riemannian manifold and the tangent space T_{\varvec{\omega }} spanned by {\mathcal {M}} is given by
\begin{aligned} \dot{l}(y,\varvec{\theta }|\varvec{\omega })= & {} \Big (\frac{\beta _1-\beta _{01}-\omega _{\beta _1}}{\sigma _{\beta _1}^2},\ldots ,\frac{\beta _p-\beta _{0p}-\omega _{\beta _p}}{\sigma _{\beta _p}^2},\frac{\alpha _0-\omega _{\alpha _0}}{\sigma _{\alpha _0}^2},\frac{\alpha _1-\omega _{\alpha _1}}{\sigma _{\alpha _1}^2},\frac{\lambda -\mu _\lambda -\omega _\lambda }{\sigma _\lambda ^2},\\{} & {} -\frac{\int _{0}^{1} \text{ln}\rho _0(1-\rho _0)^{b_\rho {}_0-1}\rho _0^{a_\rho {}_0+\omega _\rho {}_0-1}d\rho _0}{B(a_\rho {}_0+\omega _\rho {}_0,b_\rho {}_0)}+\text{ln}\rho _0,\, \frac{q_0}{q_1+2\omega _{\sigma ^2}}-\frac{1}{2\sigma ^2},\, \frac{b_1-\omega _b{}_1}{\sigma _{\beta _1}^2},\\{} & {} \ldots ,\frac{b_{20}-\omega _{b_{20}}}{\sigma _{b_{20}}^2}\Big ). \end{aligned}
Then, we obtain
\begin{aligned} {\textbf {G}}(\varvec{\omega }^0)= \,& {} \textrm{diag}\Big (\frac{1}{\sigma _{\beta _1}^2},\ldots ,\frac{1}{\sigma _{\beta _p}^2},\frac{1}{\sigma _{\alpha _0}^2},\frac{1}{\sigma _{\alpha
