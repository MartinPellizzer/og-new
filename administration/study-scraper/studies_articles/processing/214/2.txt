The results of the pre-oxidation experiments showed that the percentages of dissolved Cu, Fe, and Zn increased with increasing pre-oxidation time when the acidity was maintained at pH 2, using pure O2 as the ozone raw material. The direct pre-oxidation process at pH 2 using air as the ozone raw material also increased gold extraction from 79.08% to 82.78% in the cyanidation process.
