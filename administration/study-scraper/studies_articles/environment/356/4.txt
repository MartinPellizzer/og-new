In conclusion, this study has advanced our understanding of dry lightning in the WUS and its associated meteorological conditions, wildfire ignitions, air quality impacts, and future projections. The results highlight the need for more accurate and spatially explicit predictions of dry lightning to inform wildfire management and air quality planning decisions. By applying these findings, researchers, forecasters, and fire managers can better anticipate possible wildfire ignitions in the present climate and plan for future lightning-caused wildfires in the WUS.
