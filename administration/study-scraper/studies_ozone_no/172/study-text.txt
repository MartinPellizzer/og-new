Abstract
The performance of catalytic ability of MFe2O4/MoS2 in the ozonation process was investigated in this work. The synthesized MnFe2O4/MoS2 was optimize prepared and then characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photo-electron spectroscopy, and magnetic saturation strength. The results showed that when Cphenol = 200 mg/L, initial pH = 9.0, Q = 0.10 L/min, and CMnFe2O4/MoS2 = 0.10 g/L, MnFe2O4/MoS2 addition improved the degradation efficiency of phenol by 20.0%. The effects of pH, catalyst dosage, and inorganic ions on the phenol removal by the MnFe2O4/MoS2 catalytic ozonation were investigated. Five cycle experiments proved that MnFe2O4/MoS2 had good recyclability and stability. MnFe2O4/MoS2 also showed good catalytic performance in the treatment of coal chemical wastewater pesticide wastewater. The MnFe2O4 doped with MoS2 could provide abundant surface active sites for ozone and promote the stable cycle of Mn2+/Mn3+and Fe2+/Fe3+, thus generating large amounts of •OH and improving the degradation of phenol by ozonation. The MnFe2O4/MoS2/ozonation treatment system provides a technical reference and theoretical basis for industrial wastewater treatment.
