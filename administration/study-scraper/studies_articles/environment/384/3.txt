The findings of this study provide essential insights into understanding the intricate relationship among human activities, seasonal fluctuations, and pollutant emissions and transport that influence O3 levels across Arizona. The study highlights the importance of dividing the Arizona summer season in future studies, as O3 regimes are significantly influenced by seasonal variations. Additionally, the study demonstrates that human activities can impact O3 concentrations, with reduced NOx emissions during a lockdown period resulting in decreased O3 levels.
