great, now do STEP 7 — “How to explore applications” guidance section. explain it to me in detail ad give me the best code. How to explore applications



ACTION PLAN — applications.html (Standalone, STA-Ready)
STEP 1 — Define the single purpose of applications.html

Purpose

Introduce all ozone applications

Explain how ozone is used across environments

Act as the root node of the Applications knowledge graph

What it must NOT do

Solve problems

Sell products

Go deep into any single use case

STA rule

One page = one dominant intent

This page = orientation + authority

STEP 2 — Decide the information hierarchy of the page

This page should answer, in order:

What does “applications of ozone” mean?

In which environments is ozone used?

How should a reader explore deeper topics?

Why should they trust you as the source?

This hierarchy determines the layout.

STEP 3 — Global document structure (HTML skeleton)

Required semantic elements

<html lang="en">

<head>

<title> (neutral, encyclopedic)

<meta name="description">

<body>

<header> → global navigation

<main> → only applications content

<footer>

STA rule

<main> must contain only application-related knowledge

STEP 4 — Main heading & topical declaration

Goal

Declare topical ownership immediately

Elements

<h1> → “Applications of Ozone”

Short <p> directly under <h1>

Content role

Define ozone applications broadly

Mention residential, commercial, industrial contexts

No links yet

STA reason

Google needs a clear topic declaration early

STEP 5 — Introductory explanatory section (context-setting)

Goal

Educate users who don’t yet know what ozone can do

Elements

<section>

<h2> → “What Are Ozone Applications?”

2–3 paragraphs of explanation

Content scope

Why ozone is used

General benefits

Types of environments (high-level)

Future-proofing

Do NOT mention specific facilities or problems yet

STEP 6 — Primary Applications categories section (core of the page)

Goal

Present the main navigational branches

Even if subpages don’t exist yet

Elements

<section>

<h2> → “Ozone Applications by Environment”

<div> or <section> blocks for each category

Categories (minimum)

Residential Applications

Commercial Applications

Industrial Applications

Each category block contains:

<h3> → category name

<p> → short explanation

Optional placeholder link (# or future URL)

STA rule

These are semantic anchors, even before links exist



STEP 7 — “How to explore applications” guidance section

Goal

Help users self-orient

Reduce bounce rate

Prepare them for future depth

Elements

<section>

<h2> → “How to Explore Ozone Applications”

<ul> or structured paragraphs

Explain

You can explore by environment

You can explore by type of operation

You can explore by specific areas (rooms, zones)

STA benefit

Teaches users how your knowledge system works



STEP 8 — Authority & scope declaration section

Goal

Establish leadership without marketing fluff

Elements

<section>

<h2> → “Our Approach to Ozone Applications”

Paragraphs describing:

manufacturer perspective

custom system design

real-world deployments

Important

No calls to action

No product links yet

STA reason

Explains why your information is comprehensive and trustworthy



STEP 9 — Future-facing internal linking placeholders (very important)

Goal

Prepare the page to link downward later

Elements

<section>

<h2> → “Detailed Application Areas”

<ul> with non-clickable or placeholder items

Example items:

Food industry facilities

Cold storage environments

Residential air treatment

Water treatment systems

Why

These list items will become real links later

No layout change required



STEP 10 — Content boundaries disclaimer (optional but powerful)

Goal

Prevent intent confusion

Elements

<aside> or <section>

Brief explanation:

this page introduces applications

detailed problems & solutions live elsewhere

STA benefit

Keeps topical purity

Helps Google separate hubs from leaf pages



STEP 11 — Footer contextual reinforcement

Goal

Reinforce topical network

Elements

<footer>

Links (even placeholders) to:

Problems

Products

About your technology

Why

Signals a broader ecosystem

No dependency on subpages yet



STEP 12 — What NOT to include (critical)

To keep it future-proof, do not include:

Product grids

Technical specs

Problem-solving guides

Industry regulations

Sales CTAs

Those belong downstream.



STEP 13 — Minimal CSS layout guidance (conceptual only)

Design goals

Clear vertical hierarchy

Scannable sections

No visual dependency on subpages

Structural ideas

One-column layout

Clear spacing between <section>

Visual boxes for application categories

No CSS implementation yet.



STEP 14 — Ready-for-expansion checklist

Before publishing, verify:

Every category can become a link later

No section will need to be removed

Headings form a clean H1 → H2 → H3 tree

Content is timeless (no “coming soon” language)



STEP 15 — Publishing mindset

Once live:

This page is finished enough

You do NOT revisit it when adding child pages

You only activate links

This is the core of scalable STA.
