Atmospheric reactions play a crucial role in complex mechanisms such as climate change, greenhouse effect, and air pollution. One of these mechanisms is the oxidation mechanism of the earth's atmosphere, which involves the reaction of a chemical species with an oxygen-containing compound. This process is essential for understanding atmospheric chemistry and its impact on our environment. Despite significant efforts to solve the reactions in this mechanism using experimental techniques and theoretical model studies, uncertainties remain due to experimental processes.
