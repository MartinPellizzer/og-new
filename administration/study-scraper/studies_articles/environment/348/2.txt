The results revealed that the proposed model can accurately predict both the rapid initial ozone demand (occurring at very short timescales <10 s) and the slower ozone decomposition processes (occurring at longer timescales >30 s). The model's predictions were found to be satisfactory, with residual values (RMSE ≤ 7·10-6 mM) observed in all cases. Furthermore, a global sensitivity analysis was conducted to refine and simplify the model, which led to the elimination of three reactions connected to the generation and consumption of radicals.
