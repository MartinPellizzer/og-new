Here is a summary of the study in 1 detailed paragraph:

This study proposes a stakeholder-centered approach to address passive exposure to Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) through biosolids from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). PFAS, known for their water and stain repellency, heat resistance, and chemical stability, persist extensively in the environment, bioaccumulating within organisms and leading to serious health complications. The study recommends a collaborative body, modeled after the Ozone Transport Assessment Group (OTAG), comprising diverse stakeholders, including state and federal EPA, industry representatives, environmental advocacy groups, and community leaders, to curate credible knowledge about PFAS and funnel it to policymakers through transparent meetings. This approach aims to minimize passive exposure from PFAS in biosolids while regulatory measures are developed to address this critical policy concern.
