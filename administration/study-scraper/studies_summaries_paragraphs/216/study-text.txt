Here is a summary of the study in one detailed paragraph, focusing on the information and data related to ozone:

The study investigated the monthly and seasonal variations of UV Erythema radiation over Tehran from 2013-2023 using solar radiation and total ozone data. Total ozone data was measured by a Dobson spectrometer at the Geophysics station, with results showing a clear negative correlation between total ozone and UV-index for warm months (May-July). The study found that the UV Erythema index is highest in July, reaching an extreme level of 12.06, indicating a need for protective measures. The research also showed a power relationship between total ozone and UV-index (∝〖To〗^(-1.635)) and that the trend of UV Erythema index has been increasing over the period, potentially exposing people in Tehran to more UV radiation due to climate change.
