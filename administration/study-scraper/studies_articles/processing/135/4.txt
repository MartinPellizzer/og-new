In conclusion, this study demonstrates the effectiveness of catalytic ozonation using Î³-alumina catalysts in removing COD from Fluoxetine-containing wastewater. The optimized process conditions achieved a maximum COD removal efficiency of 92.13% under optimal conditions of reaction time (30 min), catalyst amount (1 g/L), and ozone concentration (30 mg/L). These results contribute to the development of sustainable and efficient methods for treating pharmaceutical wastewater, thereby reducing environmental pollution and promoting public health.
