To assess the impact of UGS-BVOC emissions on urban O3 levels, we utilized the Weather Research and Forecasting Model with the Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature (WRF-MEGAN) and the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model with a high horizontal resolution of 1 km. We also used satellite data to estimate BVOC emissions from UGS and terrestrial vegetation. The models were validated using observed O3 concentrations in Guangzhou during September 2017.
