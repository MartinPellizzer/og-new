Here is a summary of the study in one detailed paragraph, focusing on ozone-related information:

The study presents an integrated analysis of emissions, pollutant concentrations, and health impacts over Cyprus, using data from the LIFE SIRIUS project. The results show that while concentrations of most pollutants are below limit values established by Cypriot and European legislation, the target value for ozone is exceeded. The increasing trend in ozone concentration is accompanied by a decreasing trend in nitrogen oxides, possibly due to traffic-related measures. Additionally, the study finds that heat stress and air pollution synergy have compounding effects on mortality risk, particularly among the elderly population, using 16 years of data on temperature, pollutant concentrations, and daily mortality.
