The article discusses the technical aspects of using ozone and hypochlorites to disinfect surfaces. Ozone is a promising alternative to chlorine-containing disinfectants, as confirmed by previous studies. However, the disinfection of surfaces remains a poorly understood area. The authors analyze the technical aspects of using ozone and hypochlorites, including ozone generation, dissolution in water, parameter control, ozone destruction, microbial inactivation efficiency, and safety.
