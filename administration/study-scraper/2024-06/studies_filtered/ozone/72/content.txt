Abstract
Before the introduction of synthetic dyes in 1856, natural dyes from plants and insects were commonly used to color fabrics. However, these dyes are prone to fading and damage, posing challenges for conservators when cleaning, preserving, or displaying historical textiles. To address this issue, creating mimic samples that accurately replicate the conditions of these valuable artifacts provides a valuable opportunity for conservation research and testing of materials. This study aims to explore the feasibility of using the UV/Ozone technique  to create  artificial samples of faded dyed woolen fabric that resembles ancient textiles, without damaging the original artifacts. These samples could be used as models in conservation laboratories. Three natural dyes (Turmeric, madder, and cochineal) were used to dye new wool fabrics, with different mordants (alum, potassium dichromate, and copper sulfate) to achieve various hues. The dyed wool samples were then artificially aged using UV/Ozone for different durations. The color of the samples gradually faded as they aged, with changes in the CIE L*a*b* parameters and overall color difference (Î”E*) analyzed. The morphology and mechanical properties, including tensile strength and elongation, were also studied. Yellow dyes were found to be the most light-sensitive, while red dyes aged faster. The results suggest that artificial aged wool textile samples can be quickly created for experimental purposes, providing valuable insights for conservation research.

Highlights
This research offers a new eco-friendly and fast accelerated aging technique.
UV/Ozone showed high performance aging effect on wool fabric samples.
Simulated samples to historical textiles are achieved throughout this work
Morphological, mechanical, and color parameters proved the efficiency of the ageing process. 
Three natural dyes mordanted with three mordants were chosen to achieve different chroma and hues.
