The researchers employed the Hamiltonian operator based on the unitary Lie algebra to compute the combinational vibrational frequencies of ozone. They extended their computation up to the sixth overtone, which was achieved by solving the Schr√∂dinger equation using a numerical approach. The experimental findings and fundamental vibrational spectra were obtained from previous studies and compared with the computed results.
