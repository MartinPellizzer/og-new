In conclusion, this study demonstrates the value of direct ozone production rate measurements in understanding the intricacies of O3 formation in high-altitude cities like Lhasa. The results provide new insights into the complex relationships between atmospheric oxidant capacity, precursor emissions, and environmental factors that drive ozone pollution in these environments. By incorporating these findings into air quality management strategies, policymakers can better address the pressing issue of O3 pollution in Tibetan Plateau cities.
