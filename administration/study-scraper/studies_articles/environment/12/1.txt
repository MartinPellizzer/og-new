The methods employed in this study involve an update on the progress in thermal decomposition, direct catalytic decomposition (deN2O), and selective catalytic reduction of N2O. The researchers also investigate emerging catalysts, including nanostructured materials and single-atom catalysts, to enhance efficiency in treatment and explore potential valorization. Additionally, room-temperature techniques characterized by low energy consumption and sustainable merits are examined.
