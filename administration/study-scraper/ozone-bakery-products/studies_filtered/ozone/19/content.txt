Abstract
Deoxynivalenol (DON) is a secondary metabolite produced by Fusarium fungi, which is found in a wide range of agricultural products, especially in wheat, barley, oat and corn. In this study, the distribution of DON in the wheat kernel and the effect of exposure time to ozone on DON detoxification were investigated. A high concentration of toxin was found in the outer part of the kernel, and DON was injected from the outside to the inside. The degradation rates of DON were 26.40%, 39.16%, and 53.48% after the samples were exposed to 75 mg/L ozone for 30, 60, and 90 min, respectively. The effect of ozonation on wheat flour quality and nutrition was also evaluated. No significant differences (P > 0.05) were found in protein content, fatty acid value, amino acid content, starch content, carbonyl and carboxyl content, and swelling power of ozone-treated samples. Moreover, the ozone-treated samples exhibited higher tenacity and whiteness, as well as lower extensibility and yellowness. This finding indicated that ozone treatment can simultaneously reduce DON levels and improve flour quality.

Introduction
Deoxynivalenol (DON), a secondary metabolite produced by Fusarium fungi, is a common contaminant in wheat, barley, oat, and corn[1,2]. Fusarium head blight, a fungal disease caused by several Fusarium species, occurs during wheat plant growth under humidity conditions suitable for fungal growth and temperate weather[3]. This disease causes two forms of agricultural damage: reduction in harvest because of grain shriveling and threat to food safety because of DON accumulation in grains by several Fusarium species[4]. Human and animal exposure to DON via ingestion of contaminated food can induce acute and chronic effects, such as immunosuppression, neurotoxicity, embryotoxicity, and teratogenicity[5–7]. The International Agency for Research on Cancer categorized DON as a Group 3 carcinogen[8]. Thus, safe, economical, and cost-effective technologies must be developed to reduce fungal growth and remove DON in wheat grains while mitigating post-harvest losses. DON detoxification involves physical, chemical, and biological methods[9–12]. However, each technique exhibits certain limitations, such as nutrition loss, sensory attribute reduction, inconvenient operation, and high equipment cost, thereby hindering their practical applications.
Ozone has been widely used in the food industry as an effective antimicrobial agent for DON detoxification because of its potential oxidizing capacity[13]. The use of ozone in gaseous or aqueous phase as an antimicrobial agent has been approved by the US FDA according to the Federal Register provisions[14] and good manufacturing practices for processing and storage of food, bottled water, apple juice, and cider[15]. The advantages of ozone over traditional fumigants are as follows: (a) ozone rapidly decomposes (half-life of 20–50 min) to molecular oxygen, (b) leaves no residue, (c) can be generated on site, and (d) requires no storage and subsequent disposal of chemical containers[16]. Ozone can also kill pests in food and inactivate microbes, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses[17–19]. As such, ozone has been widely used to control the growth of various fungi in laboratory-scale trials in food, such as red pepper, wheat, dried fig, and peanut[20–24]. Since 1960, numerous studies have suggested that ozone treatment effectively degrades AFB1, the most toxic compound among various fungi; moreover, the degradation products of AFB1 after reacting with ozone has been widely studied[25–28]. However, data on DON degradation after ozone treatment are limited, and few studies have examined the effect of ozone treatment on the processing performance of wheat flour[29,30]. The limited studies on this field could be due to legislation that prohibits chemical treatment and uncertainty over the identity of reaction products.
Ozone treatment, a chemical detoxification method, can effectively control fungi in grains and may affect the quality of wheat in several aspects. Ozone can induce oxidation and/or modification of the physicochemical constituents of grains through lipid and starch oxidation, protein modification, grain discoloration, or changes in flour functionality. Sandhu et al.[31] found that ozone treatment can oxidize lipids, enhance brightness, reduce yellow hue, and increase peak and setback viscosities of flour. Violleau et al.[32] reported that ozonation can efficiently modify the technological properties of wheat grain.
Wheat and wheat products are consumed as food by approximately half of the world’s population[15]; as such, the property of wheat after ozone treatment must be elucidated for human dietary purposes. A commercially acceptable method for detoxifying DON must be developed for application in the food industry. The present study aimed to (1) investigate the distribution of DON in the wheat kernel and the effects of duration of ozone exposure on DON detoxification to propose a practical method for ozonation detoxification, and (2) assess wheat flour quality and nutrition changes caused by ozonation.
Materials and Methods
Materials
Wheat samples.
Wheat samples naturally contaminated with DON (Wanmai 50) were obtained from Suzhou City, Anhui Province, People’s Republic of China (E116°09′–118°10′, N 33°18′ –34°38′) at the end of June 2013. The DON level reached 1.69 mg/kg.
Methods
Ozone treatment of wheat grains.
Grains (20 kg) were subjected to ozone treatment using the procedure of Luo et al.[28] with minor modification. Wheat samples were placed in an airtight stainless steel reactor (70 cm in diameter and 140 cm in height). Ozone was produced using YG100 ozone generator (Beijing Shanmeishuimei Industry Co. Ltd., Beijing, China). Ozone gas (75 mg/L) was introduced into the ozone detector (Ideal-2000, Ideal Co. Ltd., Zibo, China) and then into the bottom of the reactor via a glass tube. Another ozone detector was connected to the outlet of the reactor to maintain the concentration of ozone. A disposal apparatus (model DT250, Qingdao Guolin Industry Co. Ltd., Qingdao, China) was used to rapidly convert residual ozone into oxygen after the reaction with the samples. The ozone detector was used to detect ozone concentration in gas flow from the disposal apparatus. Wheat grains were exposed to ozone for 0, 30, 60, or 90 min at 25°C under 75% RH. During the treatment, grains were agitated in the reactor by using a central endless screw. After the ozone treatment, the grains were stored in clean polyethylene bags, which were either sealed and stored at 4°C for further analysis or used in milling.
Milling.
Water (2% to 5% of dry weight) was added to the treated wheat grains to reach 15% to 16% (w/w) moisture content, depending on the initial water content. Each wheat sample was milled on a Buhler laboratory experimental mill (MLU-202) in accordance with the International Approved Methods 26–21.02[33] to obtain three samples of breaking flours (1B, 2B, and 3B), three samples of middling flours (1M, 2M, and 3M), and two samples of outer-layer fractions (bran and shorts). The milling room was maintained at 23°C–25°C under 40%–50% relative humidity. The milling recovery was 93% to 95%. The homogenous blend of 1B, 1M, 2B, 2M, 3B, and 3M fractions in a plastic bag (70 cm × 100 cm) was shaken 20 times to obtain a patent flour sample.
DON analysis.
Wheat grain samples were analyzed using immunoaffinity columns for the cleaning step and LC/UV for detection according to the Chinese National Standard [34] with minor modifications. Briefly, 25 g of the sample was placed into a 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask and added with 100 mL of acetonitrile–water (84/16, V/V). The solution was mixed for 30 min under 200 r/min, filtered, and cleaned using a solid-phase extraction cleanup column (Mycosep227#, Romer Labs Inc., USA). Eluate (2 mL) was collected and evaporated using a heating block device at 50°C in a gentle nitrogen stream. Dry extract was then redissolved in 1 mL of acetonitrile–water (6:94, V/V) and filtered through a 0.22 μm filter membrane prior to high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis.
The extract (20 μL) was injected into the LC/UV system at 218 nm, and the mobile phase was delivered at a constant flow rate of 0.8 mL/min. The total run time was 20 min, and the retention time of DON was 12.3 min. DON level was determined by comparing the measurement of the peak area at the DON retention time and that of the standard solutions used for the calibration curve (0.2, 0.5, 1, 3, 5, 10, 15, and 20 μg/mL; correlation r = 0.997).
Protein and lipid analyses and alveographic measurements.
Protein content of wheat flour was determined according to the AACC International Approved Methods 46–12.01 by using nitrogen with a protein conversion of (N) × 5.7[33]. Alveographic measurements were performed based on Standard NF ISO 5530–4[35] with a Chopin NG alveograph (Chopin Technologies, Paris, France). The alveograph parameters were automatically recorded using the Chopin Alveolink-NG software; these parameters included the maximum overpressure or tenacity (P) needed to blow the dough bubble; abscissa at rupture (L), which measures dough extensibility; index of swelling (G) (measured as the square root of the volume of air necessary to inflate the dough bubble until it ruptures); deformation energy of dough (W), which represents the energy necessary to inflate the dough bubble to the point of rupture; deformation curve (P/L), and elasticity index (Ie). The alveograph W value could be considered as the indicator of gluten strength, whereas the alveograph P/L value represents the balance of elasticity and extensibility[36].
Fatty acid value was evaluated based on the method described by Rose et al.[37] to determine the effect of ozone exposure on fat components of wheat flour. The final results were expressed in terms of milligrams of KOH required to neutralize free fatty acid in 100 g of wheat flour (dry basis).
Color measurement of wheat flour.
Color of the wheat flour samples was evaluated using Ultra Scan Pro 1166 (Hunterlab, USA) and expressed as L*, a*, and b*. L* denotes a measurement of brightness (0–100), a* represents the red–green coordinates (− is green and + is red), and b* measures the blue–yellow coordinates (− is blue and + indicates yellowness) of the product. All these tests were conducted in triplicate.
Analysis of amino acids by HPLC.
Amino acids were analyzed using HPLC according to the method developed by Yuetong et al.[38] with minor modifications. A sample (300 mg) was weighed into a screw-capped test tube and added with 6 M hydrochloric acid (8 mL) to determine amino acid content. The tubes were capped and hydrolyzed for 24 h at 110°C. After hydrolysis, the mixture was transferred to a 25 mL volumetric flask with ultrapure water and then decanted through filter paper (Whatman No. 1). The filtrate was evaporated to dryness under vacuum, and the hydrolysates were reconstituted in 1 mL of 0.02 M hydrochloric acid.
Analyses were performed on an Agilent 1100 HPLC (Palo Alto, CA, USA) equipped with a UV detector. Chromatographic separation was performed using an ACE HPLC column (C18-HL; HiChrom, Reading, UK) with a particle size of 5 μm (250 mm × 4.6 mm). Detection wavelength was 338 nm, and the column temperature was maintained at 40°C. The mobile phases used were as follows: (A) 0.10 mol/L sodium acetate buffer (pH 7.2 adjusted with acetic acid solution, 5% v/v) containing 0.0225% (v/v) triethylamine and 0.5% (v/v) tetrahydrofuran; and (B) 40:40:20 (v/v) mixture of acetonitrile, methanol, and 0.36 mol/L sodium acetate (pH 7.2
