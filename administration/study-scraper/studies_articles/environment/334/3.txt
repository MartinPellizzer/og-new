The identification of sRNAs regulated by FNR transcriptional regulators provides new insights into the complex regulatory networks controlling denitrification. The characterization of these sRNAs has implications for our understanding of N2O emissions and their regulation. Future studies can build on these findings to elucidate the mechanisms by which these sRNAs regulate denitrification and identify potential targets for mitigating N2O emissions.
