Here is a summary of the study in 1 detailed paragraph, focusing on the information and data related to ozone:

The study investigated the impact of air pollution on human health in Delhi, India, over a five-year period (2019-2023). The researchers collected data from continuous ambient air quality monitoring stations and analyzed the concentrations of six key pollutants: particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), benzene, and toluene. The results showed that the concentrations of PM10 and PM2.5 exceeded both national and global guidelines across all sites throughout the study period, with industrial sites classified as severe category according to the National Air Quality Index. Notably, the ozone formation potential (OFP) of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) was observed to be higher at industrial sites compared to commercial sites. The AirQ+ model analysis revealed a strong association between PM10 exposure and mortality from respiratory diseases, while long-term PM2.5 exposure was linked to an increased risk of stroke and circulatory mortality. Specifically, the study found that the ozone concentration ranged from 3.0-70.25 μg m−3 at PUSA (industrial site) and 1.03-58.21 μg m−3 at National Stadium (commercial site), with the highest OFP observed in industrial areas.
