ABSTRACT
Background: We aimed to determine the feasibility of ozone for disinfection of infectious solid waste in hospital.
Methods: Spores of Bacillus atrophaeus were used to monitor the process of inactivating microbial agents using ozone in medical solid waste in the hospitals of Tabriz City, Iran. For this purpose, culture medium containing the mentioned bacteria was placed in the bags containing medical wastes. The ozone generator was equipped with a constant dose of 5 grams per liter, with a discharge of 1 and 3 liters per minute and contact time of 10 to 120 min. Then the ozone exposure indicators were incubated for 24-48h at 36 ± 1 °C and, finally, the absence of colony growth in the culture medium was considered as the success of ozone in disinfection of infectious solid waste. This process was performed with 4-time replications.
Results: The complete removal of B. atrophaeus was obtained for non-compacted and compacted infectious solid waste, at contact time of 15 and 50 min, respectively. The efficiency of removal of B. atrophaeus by the process of wet ozone injection through a glass column was 100% in 30 minutes and by separate injection of water vapor into the contact tank was 100% in 50 minutes. The results of this study showed that the use of ozone technology was effective in the inactivation and destruction of microbial agents in medical solid waste.
Conclusion: Employing different advanced technology of oxidization especially ozone in order to decrease the environmental pollution is considered as one of management approaches.
