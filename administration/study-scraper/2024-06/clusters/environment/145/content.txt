Abstract
Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) significantly impact air quality and atmospheric chemistry, influencing ozone formation and secondary organic aerosol production. Despite their importance, the uncertainties associated with representing VOCs in atmospheric emission inventories are considerable. This work presents a spatiotemporal assessment and evaluation of benzene, toluene, and xylene (BTX) emissions and concentrations in Spain by combining bottom-up emissions, air quality modelling techniques, and ground-based observations. The emissions produced by High-Elective Resolution Modelling Emission System (HERMESv3) were used as input to the Multiscale Online Nonhydrostatic AtmospheRe CHemistry (MONARCH) chemical transport model to simulate surface concentrations across Spain. Comparing modelled and observed levels revealed uncertainty in the anthropogenic emissions, which were further explored through sensitivity tests. The largest levels of observed benzene and xylene were found in industrial sites near coke ovens, refineries, and car manufacturing facilities, where the modelling results show large underestimations. Official emissions reported for these facilities were replaced by alternative estimates, resulting in varied improvements in the model's performance across different stations. However, uncertainties associated with industrial emission processes persist, emphasising the need for further refinement. For toluene, consistent overestimations in background stations were mainly related to uncertainties in the spatial disaggregation of emissions from industrial-use solvent activities, mainly wood paint applications. Observed benzene levels in Barcelona's urban traffic areas were 5 times larger than the ones observed in Madrid. MONARCH failed to reproduce the observed gradient between the two cities due to uncertainties arising from estimating emissions from motorcycles and mopeds, as well as from different measurement methods and the model's capacity to accurately simulate meteorological conditions. Our results are constrained by the spatial and temporal coverage of available BTX observations, posing a key challenge in evaluating the spatial distribution of modelled levels and associated emissions.

1 Introduction
Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) significantly contribute to air pollution and pose serious health hazards to humans. These compounds originate from diverse sources, resulting from anthropogenic and biogenic activities (Kansal, 2009). They can also be produced by the oxidation of other VOCs, with this secondary formation being predominant for some VOCs (e.g. formaldehyde) (Parrish et al., 2012; Luecken et al., 2012). Anthropogenic sources include various human-driven activities, such as solvent use, traffic and fuel evaporation, and industrial emissions, as well as residential biomass burning (Monks et al., 2015; Kansal, 2009). Within urban areas, VOC emissions are predominantly influenced by human activities, with vehicular emissions representing over 60 % of VOCs in European urban areas (Borbon et al., 2018). Meanwhile, biogenic VOCs (BVOCs) also play a crucial role in atmospheric chemistry. Globally, BVOCs represent a larger fraction of total VOCs and exhibit higher chemical reactivity compared to many anthropogenic VOCs (Guenther et al., 2006). Additionally, it is important to note that human-induced atmospheric changes, driven by emissions from sources like industrial processes, transportation, and agriculture, increase oxidant levels, which can also boost natural aerosol production like biogenic secondary organic aerosol (SOA; Kanakidou et al., 2000).
One essential aspect of VOCs is their contribution to tropospheric chemistry, as they are major precursors for ozone (O3) (Atkinson and Arey, 2003; Carter, 1990) and/or secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation (Chen et al., 2022; Ziemann and Atkinson, 2012). In Spain, for specific areas and conditions, VOCs contribute to high-O3-concentration episodes (In't Veld et al., 2024; Querol et al., 2017, 2018; Castell et al., 2008). For example, in Barcelona, In't Veld et al. (2024) estimated that anthropogenic VOCs were significant contributors to O3 formation, accounting for 38 % and 49 % of the measured ozone formation potential (OFP) during winter and summer, respectively. Also, Oliveira et al. (2023) showed that in Spain, toluene and xylene are in the top 5 main species contributing to OFP, while benzene, although having a low reactivity, is in the top 20 species contributing to OFP. Moreover, they play a key role in the formation of SOA (Baltensperger et al., 2005; Cui et al., 2022; Sun et al., 2016; Jookjantra et al., 2022), which significantly contributes to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) (Srivastava et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2019; Ziemann and Atkinson, 2012). Huang et al. (2014) found that SOA contributes about 30 % to 77 % of PM2.5 mass concentrations in their study, which focused on severe haze pollution events in specific urban areas.
While some VOCs may not be associated with acute health impacts, they can still lead to chronic health risks (Shuai et al., 2018; Alford and Kumar, 2021). Notably, aromatic compounds, such as benzene, toluene, and xylene (commonly referred to as BTX), are of particular concern (Filley et al., 2004; Tagiyeva and Sheikh, 2014; Niaz et al., 2015; Ling et al., 2023), with benzene being classified as a group A carcinogenic compound by the US Environmental Protection Agency (Bayliss et al., 1998). This study focuses on BTX because (1) they are continuously measured over time in various locations, providing an important temporal and spatial coverage; (2) they represent a substantial part of the total anthropogenic emissions – more than 20 % at the global scale according to Yan et al. (2019) and possibly more in urban areas (Bates et al., 2021); and (3) they are important precursors of O3 and SOA.
Within the air quality modelling chain, the emission inventories, while being a significant source of uncertainty, serve as key elements to understand air pollution origins, in forecasting applications, and to design effective emission abatement strategies (Russell and Dennis, 2000; Day et al., 2019). Despite the importance of VOCs, as previously stated, among all the air pollutants reported by emission inventories (e.g. NOx, SOx, CO, NH3, PM10, PM2.5), VOCs are typically associated with the highest emission uncertainty. For example, in Spain, when considering the combined uncertainty of both emission factors (EFs) and activity data, VOC emissions show uncertainties between 15.6 % and 490 % across the different sectors, which is more than for other species, such as for NOx emissions which report uncertainties between 3.6 % and 175 % (MITERD, 2022). This is mainly due to limited efforts in updating the EFs and limited information on the activity data of some key sectors (e.g. use of solvents).
Chemical transport models (CTMs) are a powerful tool for assessing and forecasting atmospheric pollutant concentrations (EC, 2008). They support the design of effective air quality (AQ) control strategies by assessing the potential impacts of specific emission reduction scenarios (Agency, 2011). When evaluated against observed pollutant concentrations, they typically provide key insights on the validity of emission inventories, even with overlapping uncertainties arising from various sources across the entire evaluation chain. These uncertainties include those related to emissions, the capability of the CTM to accurately reproduce chemical and meteorological conditions, and a wide range of uncertainties in observational data (i.e. the measurement technique, instrumentation). CTMs are most commonly evaluated on the main criteria pollutants for which more observations are available (Badia and Jorba, 2015; Georgiou et al., 2022; Skoulidou et al., 2021), but an important gap persists on the VOCs (She et al., 2023). As an example, Air Quality Expert Group (2020) recently highlighted the absence of model–observation evaluations of VOCs over the UK. This identified gap is due to several reasons: first, the models use simplified chemical mechanisms. These mechanisms group the numerous individual VOC species into broader families based on known reactions or the number of carbon bonds they possess (e.g. the Carbon Bond 2005 chemical mechanism, CB05; Yarwood et al., 2005). This grouping enables the models to accurately replicate O3–NOx chemistry with both acceptable precision and computational efficiency. This limitation not only restricts the number of species that can be individually evaluated against observations but also impacts the model's accuracy in representing them. Second, emission inventories report total VOCs, which then requires the need to use speciation profiles which are limited and commonly outdated (Oliveira et al., 2023). Third, the availability and quality of observational data for VOCs are often limited in scope (von Schneidemesser et al., 2023; She et al., 2023). Typically, continuous measurements of VOCs prioritise aromatics due to the recognised health risks associated with their exposure. Despite the EU's AQ directive (AQD) recommending the measurement of 31 VOC species, only benzene is currently regulated (EC, 2008). As for other VOCs, the measurements usually come from small campaigns which are limited in time and location (von Schneidemesser et al., 2023).
This study aims to quantify limitations and uncertainties in Spanish anthropogenic BTX emissions and to improve its representation in air quality modelling systems. To do so, we used the High-Elective Resolution Modelling Emission System (HERMESv3; Guevara et al., 2019b, 2020) model to produce gridded bottom-up emissions, which were used as input in the Multiscale Online Nonhydrostatic AtmospheRe CHemistry (MONARCH; Badia et al., 2017; Klose et al., 2021a) chemical transport model to simulate surface concentrations of benzene, toluene, and xylene (i.e. o-, m-, and p-xylene) across Spain. The modelling results were then evaluated against official ground-based observation data for the year 2019. By conducting this evaluation, we are able to identify the spatio-temporal characteristics of the observed concentrations, quantify the differences with modelled results, and link these divergences to uncertainties in the emissions used as input through a set of sensitivity analyses.
2 Data and methods
2.1 Model description
2.1.1 HERMESv3
HERMESv3 (Guevara et al., 2019b, 2020) is an open-source, parallel, and standalone multi-scale atmospheric emission modelling framework that computes anthropogenic emissions for atmospheric-chemistry models. The model consists of two modules, a global–regional module (HERMESv3_GR) and a bottom-up module (HERMESv3_BU), that can work combined or separated depending on the working domain and scope of the applications. For this work, the HERMESv3_GR module is only used to process emissions reported by the Copernicus Atmospheric Monitoring Service (CAMS) regional gridded inventory (CAMS-REGv4.2; Kuenen et al., 2022) outside of Spain as well as for the shipping sector, while the HERMESv3_BU is used to produce bottom-up anthropogenic emissions in Spain (Guevara et al., 2020).
The HERMESv3_BU module estimates anthropogenic emissions at high spatial (e.g. road link, industrial facility level) and temporal (hourly) resolution using state-of-the-art calculation methods, based on (but not limited to) the calculation methodologies reported by the European EMEP/EEA air pollutant emission inventory guidebook, which combine local activity and emission factors. Specifically for this work, the model resolution was set to feed MONARCH at a spatial resolution of 0.1° by 0.1°. The model computes bottom-up emissions from energy and manufacturing industrial facilities, road transport, residential and commercial combustion activities, other mobile sources (landing and take-off cycles in airports, agricultural machinery, recreational boats, shipping emissions in ports), fugitive emissions from fossil fuels (storage and transportation), domestic and industrial use of solvents, and agricultural activities (livestock and use of fertilisers).
The industrial emissions at the plant level used in HERMESv3 are derived from the national large point source (LPS) database and from the Spanish Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (PRTR-Spain). Both databases are compiled and maintained by the Spanish Ministry for the Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge (Ministerio para la Transición Ecológica y el Reto Demográfico, MITERD), which estimates the emissions using the information provided by the corresponding industrial facilities (MITERD, 2023, 2022). Priority is given to the LPS database when both datasets provide values for the same facility, since the data reported by the LPS database are consistent with the official inventories.
The VOC speciation mapping disaggregates total VOCs to the species needed by the atmospheric-chemistry model of interest and its corresponding gas-phase and aerosol chemical mechanism. Each
