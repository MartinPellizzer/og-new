Here is a detailed summary of the study in 1 paragraph, focusing on the information and data related to ozone:

Researchers conducted a MARVEL (Measured Active Rotation Vibration Energy Levels) analysis on high-resolution spectra of ozone ($^{16}$O$_{3}$) to obtain accurate rotation-vibration energy levels in its ground electronic state. The analysis involved processing line position data from 29 sources, resulting in the validation of 65585 ro-vibrational transitions and the determination of 16717 MARVEL energy levels with their uncertainties. The MARVEL energies extended up to 8277.30 cm$^{-1}$, including 69 vibrational levels, with a maximum rotational angular momentum quantum number (J) of 77. These results were compared with effective Hamiltonian (EH) energy levels, showing a mean energy difference of -1.54 x 10$^{-4}$ cm$^{-1}$ and standard deviation of 4.58 x 10$^{-3}$ cm$^{-1}$. Additionally, variational nuclear motion calculations were performed to obtain ro-vibrational energy levels, which were used to assess and validate the MARVEL energies, with a mean energy difference of 0.26 cm$^{-1}$ and standard deviation of 1.14 cm$^{-1}$.
