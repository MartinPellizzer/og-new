Here are five detailed paragraphs using the information from the scientific study:

**Paragraph 1**
Air pollution is a recognized risk factor associated with chronic diseases that can lead to physical and cognitive impairments in later life. As individuals age, they may experience losses of function, including difficulties with daily living activities, which can reduce their ability to live independently. While air pollution has been linked to various health outcomes, the association between long-term exposure to air pollution from different sources and loss of independence in older adults is not well understood. This study aims to investigate this relationship using a nationally representative cohort of older adults.

**Paragraph 2**
The Health and Retirement Study (HRS) was used as the sample population for this study. The HRS is a biennial survey that began recruiting in 1992 and has been following a nationally representative sample of people over the age of 50 in the United States. For this study, we included respondents with at least two interviews between 1998 and 2016, when air pollution data were available. We used spatiotemporal models to estimate mean concentrations of particulate matter (PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and ozone (O3) at each respondent's residential address over the past decade.

**Paragraph 3**
The results showed that higher exposure levels of PM2.5, NO2, and ozone were associated with increased risks of lost independence. Specifically, a one-interquartile range increase in 10-year mean concentration was associated with a 1.05-fold risk of lost independence for total PM2.5, 1.09-fold risk for road traffic-generated PM2.5, 1.13-fold risk for nonroad traffic-generated PM2.5, and 1.05-fold risk for NO2. Ozone levels were found to be associated with lower risks of lost independence, with a one-interquartile range increase in 10-year mean concentration corresponding to a 0.94-fold risk.

**Paragraph 4**
The findings of this study suggest that long-term exposure to air pollution from traffic-related sources may play an important role in the loss of independence among older adults. The association between air pollution and lost independence was found to be stronger for traffic-generated PM2.5 than for other pollutants, suggesting that reducing traffic-related air pollution could have a significant impact on preserving independence. Additionally, the study's findings highlight the importance of considering the cumulative burden of air pollution in later life.

**Paragraph 5**
In conclusion, this study provides evidence that long-term exposure to air pollution is associated with an increased risk of lost independence among older adults. The findings suggest that reducing traffic-related air pollution could be an effective strategy for preserving independence and promoting healthy aging. Further research is needed to confirm these results and to investigate the potential mechanisms underlying the relationship between air pollution and loss of independence.
