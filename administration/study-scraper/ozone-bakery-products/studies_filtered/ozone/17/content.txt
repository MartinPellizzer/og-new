Abstract:
 A limited number of studies have been conducted on the effects of ozone use on cereal and its components. Starch, an

important natural macromolecule, is an essential component of cereals. In present study, the effects of ozone on the structure,

physico-chemical and microbiological properties of wheat, corn, potato and rice starches were investigated. Wheat starch, corn starch,

potato starch and rice starch water mixtures were prepared in the ratio of 1:9 (dry sample to water ratio) and treated with ozone at a

rate of 60 g/h for 1 hour, while unozonated samples were used as controls. Light microscopy represented that the structures of corn

and potato starch samples were affected by 1 hr ozonation rather than the structures of wheat and rice starch samples. Colour of

ozone-oxidized wheat, corn and potato starch samples could meet the consumer preference due to the higher lightness, higher

whiteness and lower chroma value. However, high chroma, high yellownes and low whiteness values of ozonated rice starch is not

adequate for consumer desire. Microbiological analysis showed that 1 hr ozonation reduced the total bacteria and mould/yeast counts

significantly for all wheat, corn, potato and rice starch samples (
P
 < 0.05) due to most probably the reduced pH of samples.

Ozonation can be an alternative modification technique, but further research is needed to understand the certain benefits and

limitations of ozone applications on starch oxidation for human safety and health.

Key words:
 Ozone, starch, structure, colour, pH, microbiology.

1. Introduction

Ozone
 is
 a
 natural
 substance
 found
 in
 our

atmosphere, but it can also be produced synthetically.

Ozone is a form of oxygen that includes 3 atoms (O

) in a molecule of

oxygen. Structurally, the three atoms of oxygen are in

the form of an isoscales triangle with an angle of

116.8 degree between the 2 O-O bonds. The distance

between the bond oxygen atoms is 1.27 angstrons.

Ozone is derived from the Greek word “Ozein” which

means “to smell.” Ozone as a gas is blue; both liquid

(-111.9
 °C
 at
 1
 atmosphere)
 and
 solid
 ozone

(-192.7 °C) are an opaque blue-black colour [1]. It is

relatively unstable gas at normal temperatures and

pressures,
 is
 partially
 soluble
 in
 water,
 has
 a

characteristic
 pungent
 odour,
 and
 is
 the
 strongest

disinfectant currently available for contact with foods

[2]. The relatively high (+2.075 V) electrochemical

potential (E°, Volt) indicates that ozone is a very

favorable oxidizing agent [3]. Ozone is generated by

the exposure of air or another gas containing normal

oxygen to a high-energy source. High-energy sources

convert molecules of oxygen to molecules of ozone

(Fig. 1) [4]. Ozone must be manufactured on site for

immediate
 use,
 since
 it
 is
 unstable
 and
 quickly

decomposes to normal oxygen. The half-life of ozone

in distilled water at 20 °C is about 20 to 30 min [5].

The
 application
 of
 ozone
 in
 water
 treatment
 is

widespread throughout the world. Ozone has been

shown to be a powerful oxidant and disinfectant in

water treatments. So far, ozone has been applied mainly
