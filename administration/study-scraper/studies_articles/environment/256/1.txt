To investigate these effects, we used the Earth-system model WACCM6/CESM2 to run two simulations of TRAPPIST-1e with N2-O2 atmospheres. In one simulation, the sub-stellar point was fixed over land, while in the other, it was fixed over ocean. Both simulations included an Earth-like orography, which was generated using a combination of tectonic and volcanic processes. The model was then used to simulate the atmospheric transport and chemistry of TRAPPIST-1e under these two scenarios.
