The results showed that the O3/PMS system efficiently removed UV328, with 97.0% removal achieved within 5 minutes at an O3 flow rate of 6.4 mg/min and a PMS concentration of 2 mM. The degradation rate was positively correlated with the concentrations of oxidants. The ESR spectroscopy analysis revealed that hydroxyl radical (•OH), sulfate radical (SO4•-), and singlet oxygen (1O2) were involved in the UV328 degradation process.
