Here is a summary of the study in 1 detailed paragraph, focusing on the info and data related to ozone:

A new mathematical model was developed to describe the main phases of ozone decomposition in secondary wastewater effluent with initial ozone demand. The model incorporates lumped variables, including initial ozone demand, two classes of organic matter, radical-forming compounds, radical scavengers, and a hypothetical target contaminant. Results showed that the model can accurately predict both the rapid initial ozone demand (occurring at very short timescales <10 s) and slower ozone decomposition processes (occurring at longer timescales >30 s). A global sensitivity analysis was conducted to refine and simplify the model, eliminating three reactions connected to radical formation and consumption. The model exhibited satisfactory residual values (RMSE ≤ 7·10-6 mM) in all cases and was further validated against an independent set of ozone decomposition experiments from the literature.
