The study found that increasing the gas flow rate, liquid flow rate, ozone concentration, and initial nitric acid concentration favored a desired flat cerium (IV) concentration profile in the loop. In contrast, increasing temperature and area of components led to a decline in the equilibrium cerium (IV) concentration. The study also showed that reducing the acidity of nitric acid limited the treatment time of components. Furthermore, the choice of Ce(III) or Ce(IV) salt as a source of cerium ions had no effect on corrosion rates.
