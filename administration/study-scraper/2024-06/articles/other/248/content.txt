**Paragraph 1**
The Earth's atmosphere plays a crucial role in protecting the biosphere from harmful external influences. One such threat is nearby supernovae, which can produce intense gamma-ray bursts and a significant increase in cosmic rays. While previous studies have suggested that these events could cause mass extinctions, more recent research has disputed this conclusion. This study aims to investigate the impact of a nearby supernova on the Earth's atmosphere and climate.

**Paragraph 2**
To study the effects of a nearby supernova on the Earth's atmosphere, we used the Earth System Model with Atmospheric Chemistry (EMAC) model, which incorporates comprehensive atmospheric chemistry, propagation of GCR ionisation, and aerosol-cloud interactions. We assumed a representative nearby supernova with GCR ionisation rates in the atmosphere that are 100 times present levels. The model simulated the impacts of the increased GCR flux on atmospheric composition, including NOx, HOx, ozone, and aerosol concentrations.

**Paragraph 3**
Our results show that the effect of a short burst of gamma rays from a nearby supernova is small, as they are strongly attenuated before reaching the lower stratosphere. The intense cosmic radiation affects stratospheric ozone, but due to compensating effects in catalytic chemical cycles, ozone depletion is moderate and comparable to that from current anthropogenic emissions. Additionally, we found that the increase in aerosol and clouds from a 100-fold increase of cosmic rays exerts a radiative forcing comparable in magnitude but opposite in sign to current anthropogenic climate forcing.

**Paragraph 4**
Discussion of our results reveals that the maximum ozone depletion over the poles is less than the present-day anthropogenic ozone hole over Antarctica, which amounts to an ozone column loss of 60-70%. We also simulated a 2% oxygen atmosphere to assess the possible effect on the evolution of life during the Cambrian period. Under these conditions, ozone loss was about 10-25% at mid-latitudes and an order of magnitude lower in the tropics.

**Paragraph 5**
In conclusion, our study demonstrates that Earth's atmosphere is effective at shielding the biosphere from nearby supernovae. The results suggest that ozone depletion due to a nearby supernova would be moderate and comparable to that from current anthropogenic emissions. Furthermore, the study highlights the importance of considering the atmospheric composition and chemistry in understanding the impacts of external influences on the Earth's climate system.
