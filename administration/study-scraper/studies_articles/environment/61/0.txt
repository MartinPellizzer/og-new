The removal of pollutants from water is a pressing issue in modern times. Among various treatment technologies, catalytic ozonation has gained significant attention due to its effectiveness and eco-friendliness. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been explored as potential catalysts for ozone-based water purification, offering stability and high surface areas. However, the application of MOF-derived materials in ozone catalysis is limited, and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.
