The study reveals that changes in solar irradiance are closely linked to the Sun's magnetic activity cycles, with bright faculae and dark sunspots playing a crucial role. The models developed by the researchers demonstrate that these changes can significantly alter global climate patterns, ozone levels, and space environment conditions.
