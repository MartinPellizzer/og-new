In conclusion, this study demonstrates the ability of IASI and CrIS satellites to provide a long-term record of tropospheric ozone distributions and trends. The positive trend in daytime O3 concentrations observed over the past decade is consistent with previous findings and highlights the importance of monitoring atmospheric chemistry using satellite data. Our results emphasize the need for continued efforts to understand the underlying mechanisms driving O3 trends and their implications for climate change.
