Here is a summary of the study in one paragraph:

Researchers investigated the degradation of UV328, an emerging persistent organic pollutant, using an ozone (O3) and peroxymonosulfate (PMS) system. The results showed that 97.0% UV328 was removed within 5 minutes at neutral pH with 6.4 mg/min O3 and 2 mM PMS. The degradation rate was positively correlated with the concentration of oxidants, and hydroxyl radical (•OH), sulfate radical (SO4•-), and singlet oxygen (1O2) participated in the degradation process, with 1O2 playing a key role. Three degradation pathways were proposed: dehydrogenation, cycloaddition, and hydroxylation, while •OH and SO4•- radicals attacked UV328 through hydrogen atom abstraction and radical adduct formation pathways, respectively. Toxicity assessment revealed that O3/PMS treatment mitigated the ecological risks of UV328.
