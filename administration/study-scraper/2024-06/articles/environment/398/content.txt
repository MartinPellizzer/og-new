Here are five detailed paragraphs using the information from the scientific study:

**Paragraph 1**
Cyanobacteria have been a vital component of aquatic ecosystems for millions of years. However, due to climate change and anthropogenic pollution, cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (CyanoHABs) are expanding worldwide, posing a significant threat to human health and the environment. These blooms produce potent toxic substances, such as microcystins (MCs) and cylindrospermopsin (CYN), which can cause severe harm to animals and humans. Despite these risks, cyanobacteria have also been recognized as valuable biological resources for biotechnological applications.

**Paragraph 2**
To test cost-effective methods to reduce the toxin content of cyanobacterial biomass, lyophilized or hydrated biomass from MC-LR-producing Microcystis aeruginosa and CYN-producing Chrysosporum ovalisporum strains were subjected to thermal heating, ultraviolet (UV) radiation, ozone, and sunlight treatments. The samples were exposed for varying periods, ranging from 2 to 12 hours, with the exception of ozone treatment, which was shorter at 2.5 and 5 minutes.

**Paragraph 3**
The results show that MC-LR concentrations in M. aeruginosa biomass were significantly reduced after exposure to sunlight. In contrast, UV radiation was found to be effective in reducing CYN concentrations in C. ovalisporum biomass, with a 51% reduction observed after 2 hours of exposure and an 86% reduction after 5 hours.

**Paragraph 4**
The findings of this study suggest that environmentally friendly treatments, such as sunlight and UV radiation, can effectively reduce the toxin content of cyanobacterial biomass. These methods offer a promising approach for exploiting these valuable biological resources while minimizing environmental risks. Further studies are needed to fully understand the mechanisms behind these effects and to optimize treatment conditions.

**Paragraph 5**
In conclusion, this study demonstrates that cost-effective treatments with sunlight and UV radiation can reduce the toxicity of cyanobacterial biomass, making it more suitable for biotechnological applications. The discovery of methods to process cyanobacterial biomasses, leading to a decrease in toxic compounds, may have significant implications for the development of new products and the exploitation of this valuable resource. Future research should focus on scaling up these treatments and exploring their efficacy on different species of cyanobacteria.
