# Feature Prioritization vNext - [Aurora System]

## 1. Introduction

The **Aurora Industrial Ozone Sanitization System** was developed to address the growing demand for safe, efficient, and environmentally sustainable sanitization in industrial environments. The first generation of Aurora successfully integrated advanced ozone generation technology with intelligent automation, enabling customers across food processing, pharmaceuticals, healthcare, and logistics to meet strict regulatory standards while reducing downtime and operational costs.

As adoption grows, customer feedback, market analysis, and evolving compliance requirements highlight the need to expand Aurora’s capabilities. The next version of the system, referred to in this document as **Aurora vNext**, will focus on closing identified gaps, strengthening safety mechanisms, and delivering advanced features that improve efficiency, usability, and long-term value.

This document defines and prioritizes the **key features** under consideration for Aurora vNext. The intent is to provide a clear, evidence-based framework that will guide product management, engineering, and compliance teams in making development decisions.

### Purpose of this Document

- To **capture and define** proposed features for the next release of Aurora.
- To **prioritize features** based on safety, compliance, customer value, and technical feasibility.
- To **align stakeholders**—engineering, product management, compliance officers, and executives—around a shared roadmap.
- To serve as a **reference point** for future audits, development planning, and investment discussions.

### Audience

This document is intended for:

- **Product Managers** – to guide roadmap planning and resource allocation.
- **Engineering Teams** – to understand technical priorities and dependencies.
- **Compliance & Safety Officers** – to ensure features align with regulatory obligations.
- **Executives & Investors** – to validate that the product roadmap supports business growth and market leadership.

### Scope

The document focuses on **features planned for Aurora vNext (Aurora v2.0 and incremental updates)**. These include:

- Safety-critical improvements,
- High-value enhancements based on customer demand, and
- Future-facing features with innovation potential.

### Exclusions

This document does not cover:

- Experimental R\&D concepts without immediate feasibility,
- Long-term roadmap items reserved for Aurora v3.0+, or
- Internal engineering details beyond the feature level (covered in design specifications).
