Despite significant efforts to reduce pollution in China, surface ozone (O3) remains a pressing issue in the North China Plain (NCP). In recent years, O3 levels have shown an annual increase of 12.77 µg m-3 in summer, with a peak concentration of 174 µg m-3 in 2019. To better understand this trend and identify potential causes, this study analyzed satellite retrievals of surface O3 concentrations over the NCP from 2015 to 2021.
