Abstract
Accurate rotation-vibration (ro-vibrational) energy levels of the main isotopologue of ozone ($^{16}$O$_{3}$) in its ground electronic $\Tilde{X} ^{1}A_{1}$ state are obtained by performing MARVEL (Measured Active Rotation Vibration Energy Levels) analysis on measured line position data published in scientific literature. A total of 65825 ro-vibrational transitions are analyzed of which 65585 are validated. 16717 MARVEL energy levels of $^{16}$O$_{3}$ are obtained along with their uncertainties by analyzing 29 sources of data from literature. The MARVEL energies extend up to 8277.30 cm$^{-1}$ including 69 vibrational levels, with the maximum value of $J$ (rotational angular momentum quantum number) reaching $J=77$. MARVEL energies are compared with effective Hamiltonian (EH) energy levels with mean energy difference ($\Delta E_{mean}$) equal to $-$1.54 $\times$ 10$^{-4}$ cm$^{-1}$ and standard deviation 4.58 $\times$ 10$^{-3}$ cm$^{-1}$ for 14835 energy levels matched between them. Vibrational quantum numbers of 4898 transitions from two data sources are re-labelled by considering mixing coefficients of EH wavefunctions. Variational nuclear motion calculations are performed to obtain ro-vibrational energy levels of $^{16}$O$_{3}$ and these are subsequently used to assess and validate the MARVEL energies. All MARVEL levels are uniquely matched and validated against variational energies with $\Delta E_{mean}$ = $0.26$ cm$^{-1}$ and standard deviation 1.14 cm$^{-1}$. Any inconsistencies between MARVEL, effective Hamiltonian and variational methods are analyzed and assessed.
