Here is a detailed summary of the study in 1 paragraph:

The dissertation examines dry lightning in the Western United States (WUS), which is a major source of wildfire ignition during summer months. The study reveals an increase in co-occurring air pollutants, including fine particulate matter and ground-level ozone, during wildfire seasons over the past two decades, resulting in exposure to 25 million person-days per year. Analyzing meteorological conditions, the research identifies four types of patterns associated with dry lightning outbreaks in central and northern California. Additionally, the study refines the definition of dry lightning by demonstrating regional variation in ignition-relevant precipitation amounts dependent on topography, vegetation, and climate. The results also showcase a predictive model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that can predict cloud-to-ground lightning activity with high accuracy, enabling future projections of lightning-caused wildfires.
