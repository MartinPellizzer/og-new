The detailed mechanism of each treatment process was explored to better understand their interactions and synergies. The results suggest that the modified bentonite/UV/TiO2/ZnO photocatalyst played a crucial role in enhancing the removal efficiency of antibiotics. Furthermore, the study highlights the potential benefits of combining different treatment processes to achieve optimal performance.
