Air pollution is a significant environmental health concern that affects not only human health but also productivity. A recent study has shed light on the impact of air pollutants on labor productivity in Indian call centers. The study, titled "More than Particulates Matter: Multiple Pollutants and Productivity in Indian Call Centers," analyzed the effects of three components of air pollution - fine particulate matter (PM2.5), carbon monoxide, and ozone - on daily labor productivity. The researchers found that each of these pollutants has a negative impact on productivity, with carbon monoxide being responsible for more than half of the total productivity lost.
