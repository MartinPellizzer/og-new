The study employs various existing studies to evaluate the emission characteristics of tropospheric ozone. The researchers analyzed the factors influencing ozone formation, including high temperature and solar radiation, low relative humidity, and wind speed. These conditions were found to be optimal for ozone production, making early summer before the rainy season the worst time for ozone pollution in Korea.
