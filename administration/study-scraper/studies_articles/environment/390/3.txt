The results suggest that plant species, O3 concentration, and exposure duration are important factors affecting the response of herbaceous plants to elevated O3. The study also highlights the importance of considering the interactions between these factors when assessing the impact of elevated O3 on plant antioxidant systems. The findings have implications for understanding the mechanisms underlying plant adaptation to O3 stress under global change.
