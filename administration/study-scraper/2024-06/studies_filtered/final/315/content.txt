Abstract
en
Cold atmospheric plasmas generated in the ambient air have found applications in diverse fields, such as agriculture, biomedicine, and food processing. Plasma-activated water (PAW) is produced by treating water using by plasma and it contains various reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS), such as hydrogen peroxide, ozone, superoxide radicals and nitrite ions, among others. Combining PAW and UV radiation as an antibacterial strategy offers a synergistic and effective approach for disinfection and sterilization purposes with potential benefits in terms of efficacy, versatility, and environmental sustainability.
