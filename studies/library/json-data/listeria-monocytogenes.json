It is a facultative intracellular pathogen that can survive inside host cells. This bacterium is commonly found in soil, water, and the gastrointestinal tracts of animals. Listeria monocytogenes is a foodborne pathogen that causes listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects older adults, pregnant women, and people with weakened immune systems. The bacteria can be transmitted through contaminated food, particularly dairy products, meats, and produce, and can lead to symptoms such as fever, headache, and stiffness.", "where_is_desc": "Listeria monocytogenes is found in various environments, including soil, water, and the gastrointestinal tracts of animals and humans. It is also commonly found in food products, such as raw milk, soft cheeses, hot dogs, and deli meats, particularly those that are not properly refrigerated or handled. Outbreaks have been linked to unpasteurized dairy products, sprouts, and frozen vegetables contaminated with the bacteria. Listeria monocytogenes can be transmitted to humans through the consumption of contaminated food, contact with contaminated animals or environments, or through vertical transmission from mother to fetus during pregnancy. Infection occurs when the bacteria are ingested and pass through the gastrointestinal tract, where they can then invade the bloodstream and cause illness.", "how_you_get_desc": "Listeria monocytogenes is found in contaminated soil, water, and decaying organic matter. It is typically transmitted through consumption of contaminated food, particularly soft cheeses, hot dogs, and deli meats. Listeria monocytogenes is also found in raw vegetables, fruits, and sprouts. Outbreaks have been linked to unpasteurized dairy products, smoked fish, and ready-to-eat salads. Pregnant women, older adults, and people with weakened immune systems are at higher risk of developing listeriosis due to exposure to Listeria monocytogenes."}
