The findings of this study suggest that the use of ozone generated via DBD plasma reactor is an effective method for heavy naphtha desulfurization. The non-thermal plasma technology offers several advantages, including high efficiency, minimal waste generation, and flexibility in operating conditions. Future studies can focus on scaling up the process and exploring its application to other petroleum products.
