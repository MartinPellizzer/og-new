Here is a summary of the study in 60-80 words, focusing on the information and data related to ozone:

The optimal concentration of an ozone-containing mixture for safe use in clinical conditions was investigated. Exposure to the mixture did not cause pathological changes or significant stress response in experimental animals, confirming its safety. The study suggests that an ozone-containing steam-water mixture can be used as a factor of external physical influence with bactericidal and bacteriostatic properties, and recommends it for use in clinical practice.
