Here are the five detailed paragraphs using the information from the scientific study:

**Paragraph 1: Introduction**
Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are a significant contributor to atmospheric pollution and have been extensively studied due to their roles as precursors of ozone and secondary organic aerosol. The accurate accounting of VOC emissions is crucial for understanding their impact on air quality and climate change. This study aims to comprehensively analyze the current advancements in domestic and international VOC emission accounting, using bibliometric analysis techniques.

**Paragraph 2: Methods**
To achieve this goal, we utilized CiteSpace software to visualize the relevant material from Web of Science. We analyzed hotspots and future development trends of VOC emission calculation by examining thesis subject words, cooperative relationships, co-citation relationships, journals, and core papers. The study period spanned from 2013 to 2023, allowing us to capture recent trends and advancements in the field.

**Paragraph 3: Results**
Our analysis revealed that source analysis and emission factor method were the most frequently employed approaches during the study period. The journal "Atmospheric Environment" was found to have the highest number of publications related to VOC emission accounting. Furthermore, prominent institutions in both domestic and international research on VOC emission accounting included the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the University of Colorado System.

**Paragraph 4: Discussion**
Our results highlight the importance of source analysis and emission factor method in understanding VOC emissions. The dominance of "emission factor," "source analysis," "model," "air quality," and "health" as research foci underscores the need for interdisciplinary approaches that integrate environmental, health, and economic perspectives. The trends identified in this study can inform policymakers and researchers on strategies to mitigate VOC emissions and improve air quality.

**Paragraph 5: Conclusion**
In conclusion, our bibliometric analysis provides a comprehensive overview of current advancements and trends in VOC emission accounting. By analyzing hotspots and future development trends, we have highlighted the importance of source analysis and emission factor method, as well as the need for interdisciplinary approaches to address VOC emissions. Our study aims to inform researchers and policymakers on effective strategies to mitigate VOC emissions and improve air quality.
