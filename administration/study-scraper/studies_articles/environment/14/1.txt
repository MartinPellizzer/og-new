The study employed a detailed Lagrangian box model to simulate the photochemical processing and transport of temporally and spatially gridded emissions from the FIVE-VCP-NEI17NRT inventory, which combines emissions from fossil fuels, VCPs, and other point sources. The model was updated with recent field observations on cooking emissions and validated against measured data at a ground site in Pasadena, CA. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate ozone responses to sector-specific VOC and NOx emissions.
