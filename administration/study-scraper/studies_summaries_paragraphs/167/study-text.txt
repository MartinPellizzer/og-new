Here is a summary of the study in 1 detailed paragraph, focusing on the information and data related to ozone:

Researchers employed an ozone-activated peroxymonosulfate (O3/PMS) process to effectively degrade Tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) in semiconductor wastewater. The O3/PMS process showed a significantly higher rate constant for TMAH degradation, approximately 14.4 times that of the ozone-only process, attributed to the explosive production of hydroxyl radicals. Optimal conditions for the process were found at pH 7.0 and 40°C, with alkalinity and humic acid significantly reducing degradation efficiency due to their scavenging effects on hydroxyl radicals. Notably, removal efficiencies of 64.4% for TMAH and 43.7% for total organic carbon (TOC) were achieved at an initial concentration of 100 μM, indicating the potential of the O3/PMS process for treating wastewater containing TMAH.
