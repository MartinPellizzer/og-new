Ozone-based processes involve complex reaction networks and exhibit matrix-dependent decomposition patterns when applied to wastewater effluents. Understanding the mechanisms of ozone decomposition is crucial for optimizing these processes, as they can significantly impact the treatment efficiency and effectiveness. However, existing models for ozone decomposition are either too complex or not sufficiently descriptive of the regime manifested during initial ozone demand and decay. This study aims to address this knowledge gap by developing a new mathematical model that balances accuracy and complexity in describing the main phases of ozone decomposition.
