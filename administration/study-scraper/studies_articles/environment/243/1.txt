The methods employed in this study involve the MARVEL analysis of high-resolution spectra of $^{16}$O$_{3}$. A total of 29 sources of data from literature were used, which consisted of measured line position data. The analysis was performed using a combination of software tools and algorithms to extract accurate ro-vibrational transitions. The validated transitions were then used to obtain MARVEL energy levels along with their uncertainties.
