Abstract

Ozone (O
 3
 ) is a highly reactive and oxidative gas that induces adverse

effects
 on
 human
 health,
 including
 mortality
 and
 morbidity.

Anthropogenic
 activities
 are
 the
 primary
 sources
 of
 tropospheric
 O
 3

pollution. Primarily O
 3
 enters the human body through inhalation and

causes acute and chronic health effects. Various studies have shown that

O
 3
 exposure has affected the respiratory system, cardiovascular system,

reproductive
 system,
 and
 nervous
 system
 and
 can
 ultimately
 cause

mortality depending upon age and pre-health conditions. Some studies

suggest a direct relationship between the O
 3
 level and the degradation of

human health. This chapter will critically elucidate the severity of the

adverse effects on human health under the exposure of variable levels of

O
3
 concentrations.
