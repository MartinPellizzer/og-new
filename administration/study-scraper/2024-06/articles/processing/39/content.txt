Here are five detailed paragraphs based on the scientific study:

**Paragraph 1**
Carbon fibre-reinforced composites have become increasingly important in various industrial applications due to their exceptional mechanical properties. The interfacial bonding between carbon fibres and matrices plays a crucial role in determining the overall performance of these materials. However, the chemical inertness and hydrophobic nature of carbon fibre surfaces can hinder the formation of strong interfacial bonds with the matrix. To address this challenge, various methods have been developed to modify the surface properties of carbon fibres.

**Paragraph 2**
In this study, a combined approach was employed to modify the surface properties of desized and sized carbon fibres using ozone treatment. The carbon fibre samples were treated with ozone at a flow rate of 5 L/min for varying durations (0-60 minutes). The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was used to examine the transformation of epoxy groups into hydroxyl and carboxyl functional groups following ozonation.

**Paragraph 3**
The results showed that the ozonation process led to a significant increase in carboxyl and hydroxyl functional groups on both desized and sized carbon fibre surfaces. The XPS analysis revealed an increase in carboxyl groups from 1.27% to 8.12% for desized carbon fibres, while hydroxyl groups increased by 28.37%. Additionally, the Raman spectroscopy results showed an escalation in graphite regions during ozonation of desized carbon fibre samples.

**Paragraph 4**
The mechanical test results revealed a significant improvement in interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) and tensile strength for both desized and sized carbon fibres after ozonation. The ILSS value increased from 41 MPa to 64 MPa, while the tensile strength of sized carbon fibres increased from 772 to 831 MPa. This improvement is attributed to the increased amount of functional groups detected by XPS and Raman spectroscopy, as well as the increase in roughness.

**Paragraph 5**
In conclusion, this study demonstrates that ozonation can be an effective method for modifying the surface properties of carbon fibres. The results highlight the importance of surface modification in enhancing interfacial bonding between carbon fibres and matrices. The increased functional groups and roughness resulting from ozonation can significantly improve the mechanical properties of fibre-reinforced composites, making them more suitable for various industrial applications.
