ABSTRACT
Almost all areas of human activity influence the climate. The administration of anesthetics by inhalation is one such activity. With an increasing number of surgeries, the demand for general anesthesia by inhalation is considerable. However, widely used volatile anesthetics are greenhouse gases, ozone depleting agents, or both. In the body during clinical use eliminated unchanged by expiration, residual anesthetic gases (WAGs) in operating rooms and post-care units anesthetics can pose a challenge for overall elimination and occupational exposure. Anesthesia and care activities contribute less to greenhouse gas emissions GHGs with a significant impact estimated at 10% of emissions were related to health sector. The environmental impact generated halogenated HAs is only beginning to be taken into account. Among the most used HA desflurane and sevoflurane, a greater responsibility of desflurane sometimes associated with nitrous oxide. However, it accentuates the climatic consequences. Significant environmental impact the current trend is to reduce our GHG emissions.
