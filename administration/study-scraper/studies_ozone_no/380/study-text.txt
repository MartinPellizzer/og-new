Abstract
In this work, the productions of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) with duty ratio in atmospheric pressure plasma jet was studied. This study uses the duty ratio comprising an on-time duration with a sinusoidal voltage bunch and an off-time duration without any voltage bunch for the plasma jet operation. The reactive species NO, NO2, N2O, and O3 were measured in the plasma jet in accordance with the duty ratio by gas-FTIR and ozone meter. The NOx are the mainly produced in the plasma jet due to the high temperature, and all reactive species exhibited increased production when increasing the duty ratio. But, under the fixed duty-ratio of 10%, reactive species were different trends by the on-time duration. Although there was no additional dissipated power at a given duty ratio, NO production enhanced by 1.5 times, whereas the production of the other species decreased with increasing on-time duration. These phenomena were explained by measured rotational temperature with on-time in this experiment.
