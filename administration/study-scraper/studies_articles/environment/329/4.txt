In conclusion, while the Climate-Conscious Inhaler Prescribing Sustainable Pathway provides a valuable framework for environmentally conscious inhaler prescribing, there are significant limitations and uncertainties surrounding the actual carbon impact of switching from MDIs to DPIs. Family physicians must be aware of these limitations and consider multiple factors when making prescribing decisions. By working together, we can strive to create an environmentally sustainable future while providing high-quality care to our patients.
