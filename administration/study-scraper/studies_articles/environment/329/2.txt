The study by Green et al. (1) suggests that switching from MDIs to DPIs can reduce carbon impact, but the actual reduction is uncertain. The calculation used in the study assumes a 10-fold reduction, which may not be accurate. Additionally, the environmental impact of inhalers varies depending on the type of propellant and other factors.
