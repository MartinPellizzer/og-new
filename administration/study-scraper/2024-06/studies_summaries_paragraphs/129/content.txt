Here is a summary of the study in 1 detailed paragraph, focusing on ozone-related information:

A photocatalytic ozonation-electroflucculation process was investigated for treating pharmaceutical wastewater using a modified bentonite catalyst and UV/TiO2/ZnO system. The results showed that under optimized conditions (DC volts of 10 V; catalyst dose of 1 g/L, and ozone dose of 0.6mg/min), the hybrid process achieved a COD removal efficiency of 86.9% and turbidity removal of 81.66%. Additionally, antibiotic removal efficiencies of amoxicillin (100%) and carbamazepine (95%) were observed. The study also compared the performance of ozonation, photocatalytic ozonation, electroflucculation, catalytic ozonation, and hybrid O3/catalytic ozonation/UV/EF processes, demonstrating the effectiveness of the combined photocatalyst-based system in removing pharmaceutical pollutants from wastewater.
