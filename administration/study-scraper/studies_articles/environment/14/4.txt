In conclusion, this study provides new insights into the complex processes governing ozone formation in urban areas. By quantifying the contribution of VCPs, cooking emissions, and NOx to ozone formation, the study highlights the need for a comprehensive approach to air pollution mitigation. The findings suggest that policies targeting these sources could effectively reduce ozone concentrations in urban areas, improving public health and environmental sustainability.
