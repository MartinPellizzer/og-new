Abstract
Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) represent a pervasive group of over 15,000 chemicals characterized by their water and stain repellency, heat resistance, and chemical stability. Despite their microscopic size, many PFAS persist extensively in the environment, bioaccumulating within organisms and leading to serious health complications, including various forms of cancer and developmental problems in young children. Among the paramount threats to human health posed by PFAS, indirect contamination through food and water through biosolids emerges as a critical policy concern, as this type of exposure necessitates governmental intervention.1 Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) stand out as prime examples of passive exposure nodes, as their byproducts contain PFAS and are reused as alternatives to fertilizer, thereby contaminating the food and water of unsuspecting populations. To address this pressing issue, this paper proposes a stakeholder-centered assessment group process modeled after the Ozone Transport Assessment Group (OTAG) to address passive PFAS exposure through biosolids. This collaborative body will include diverse PFAS stakeholders, including state and federal EPA, industry representatives, environmental advocacy groups, and community leaders, to make up smaller subgroups dedicated to PFAS research. These groups will curate credible knowledge about PFAS that can be directly funneled to policymakers through transparent and open meetings, ensuring effective regulation implementation. This paper will also recommend immediate policy and regulatory measures, informed by domestic environmental legislation and innovative international pollution-regulation precedents, to minimize the risk of passive exposure from PFAS while the assessment group works on further solutions.
