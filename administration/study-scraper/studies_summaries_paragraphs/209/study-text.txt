Here is a summary of the study in 1 detailed paragraph, focusing on the information and data related to ozone:

This study evaluated the effect of atmospheric pressure plasma treatment with argon gas (AP) on the bond strength between zirconia ceramics and self-adhesive resin luting agents. The results showed that AP treatment significantly reduced the contact angle (p < 0.0001), indicating improved wetting properties, and increased shear bond strength (SBS). The combination of AP treatment with other cleaning methods, such as ozonated water or alumina blasting, resulted in higher SBS values compared to AP alone. Notably, ozone was used in conjunction with AP treatment in some experimental groups, demonstrating its potential to enhance the bonding properties between zirconia and resin luting agents. The findings suggest that using atmospheric pressure plasma with argon gas, combined with other cleaning methods, can result in stronger bonds than traditional alumina blasting alone.
