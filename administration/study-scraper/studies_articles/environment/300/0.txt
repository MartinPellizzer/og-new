The degradation of 2-(2H-benzotriazol-2-yl)-4,6-di-tert-pentylphenol (UV328) is a significant concern due to its widespread occurrence in environmental matrices and potential ecological risks. Despite various advanced oxidation processes being tested for UV328 degradation, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate the degradation of UV328 by ozone (O3) and peroxymonosulfate (PMS) systems and elucidate the involved reaction pathways.
