In conclusion, the constructed system enabling simultaneous ozonation and UV-C irradiation of cranberry fruits was effective in reducing microbiological load and extending shelf life. The implementation of this technology can contribute to sustainable and environmentally friendly cranberry cultivation and reduce waste. Further research is needed to optimize the parameters of the developed solution for different fruit varieties and storage conditions.
