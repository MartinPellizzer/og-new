Here is a summary of the study in one detailed paragraph, focusing on the information and data related to ozone:

This study examines the effects of 222 nm germicidal ultraviolet lamps on secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation and composition. The researchers compared limonene oxidation under GUV222 light with O3-only control conditions in a laboratory chamber, finding that SOA composition and yield varied only slightly between the two conditions, suggesting that ozone chemistry plays a significant role in SOA formation. However, experiments showed consistent new particle formation under high-fluence 222 nm light (45 ÂµW cm-2), which differed dramatically from ozone-only experiments, indicating that non-ozone chemical processes are also involved in aerosol formation. These findings highlight the importance of considering both ozone-initiated and non-ozone pathways in understanding SOA formation from GUV222 lamps.
