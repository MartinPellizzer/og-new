**Paragraph 1**
Sleep deprivation (SD) is a common condition that affects cognitive function and is often associated with various neurological disorders. Chronic rapid eye movement sleep deprivation-induced cognitive impairment has been linked to inflammation and alterations in gut microbiota composition. Ozone rectal insufflation (O3-RI) has been shown to have therapeutic potential for chronic diseases, but its effects on cognitive impairment induced by SD remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effects of O3-RI on cognitive dysfunction in mice subjected to chronic REM sleep deprivation.

**Paragraph 2**
The study used a total of 60 ICR male mice, which were randomly assigned to four groups: control group (Ctrl), sleep deprivation group (SD), low-concentration O3-RI group (O3-RI-L), and high-concentration O3-RI group (O3-RI-H). Chronic REM sleep deprivation was induced using the modified multiple platforms method. Mice were subjected to 20 hours of SD per day for three consecutive weeks. O3-RI treatment was performed once a day for 7 consecutive days, and mice were sacrificed after behavioral tests.

**Paragraph 3**
The results showed that O3-RI treatment significantly improved cognitive function in mice subjected to chronic REM sleep deprivation. Mice in the O3-RI-L and O3-RI-H groups exhibited improved performance in the Y-maze test, novel object recognition test, and open field test compared to the SD group. Additionally, histopathological analysis revealed reduced neuronal damage and loss in the hippocampus of mice treated with O3-RI.

**Paragraph 4**
The findings suggest that O3-RI may protect against chronic REM sleep deprivation-induced cognitive impairment by alleviating inflammation and regulating gut microbiota composition. The study also found that O3-RI reversed the abnormal expression of Occludin, leucine-rich repeat and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 inflammasome, and interleukin-1Î² in the hippocampus and colon tissues. Moreover, the results demonstrated a correlation between cognitive impairment and inflammation, highlighting the potential therapeutic benefits of O3-RI for SD-related disorders.

**Paragraph 5**
In conclusion, this study provides evidence that O3-RI can improve cognitive dysfunction in mice subjected to chronic REM sleep deprivation. The mechanism underlying this effect may involve regulation of gut microbiota composition, alleviation of inflammation, and reduction of neuronal damage. These findings have implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for SD-related disorders, including those affecting cognitive function. Future studies are needed to further investigate the effects of O3-RI on human subjects with sleep deprivation-induced cognitive impairment.
