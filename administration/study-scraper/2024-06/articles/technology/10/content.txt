Here are five detailed paragraphs based on the scientific study:

**Paragraph 1**
Fungal infections pose a significant challenge to cereal grain production and storage, resulting in economic losses and quality degradation. Malting barley, particularly vulnerable to fungal diseases, requires effective treatments to ensure its premium quality. The use of fungicides has been criticized due to their adverse environmental impact, human health risks, and potential for generating resistant strains. As an eco-friendly alternative, ozone treatment shows promise in reducing microbial load while preserving grain germination.

**Paragraph 2**
To investigate the efficacy of gaseous ozone against Fusarium infections in malting barley, a custom-designed ozonation unit was used to treat the grains with various concentrations and exposure times. The unit maintained a constant ozone concentration using a UV lamp and PID control system. Barley samples were arranged in a single layer on stainless steel sieves, and the relative humidity was regulated by saturated salt slurries. Temperature was monitored externally due to incompatibility with ozone.

**Paragraph 3**
The results showed that gaseous ozone significantly reduced fungal count and Fusarium incidence in malting barley. Higher ozone concentrations (100 ppm) and longer exposure times (24 h) yielded greater reductions, with a 99.2% reduction in total fungal count and a 98.2% reduction in Fusarium incidence achieved at the maximum treatment conditions. Grain germination exhibited a negative dose-dependent response but remained within recommended values.

**Paragraph 4**
The study highlights the importance of ozone concentration and exposure time on fungal deactivation, with ozone concentration having a greater effect than exposure time. The results also suggest that grain moisture content, relative humidity, and temperature do not significantly affect ozone's efficacy against fungi and grain germination. These findings support the potential use of ozone treatment as an eco-friendly alternative to traditional fungicides.

**Paragraph 5**
In conclusion, this study demonstrates the efficacy of gaseous ozone in reducing fungal infections and preserving grain germination in malting barley. The results suggest that ozone treatment can be a valuable tool in maintaining high-quality grains while minimizing environmental impact and human health risks associated with traditional fungicides. Further research is needed to fully explore the potential applications of ozone treatment in cereal grain production and storage.
