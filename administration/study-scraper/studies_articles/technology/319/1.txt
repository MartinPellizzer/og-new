To develop an efficient and scalable photocatalytic process, a conceptual design was implemented, integrating magnetic nanocomposites with titanium dioxide (TiO2) or zinc oxide (ZnO). The reactor configurations and operational conditions were studied under different types of light sources. The magnetic nanocomposites were synthesized using sol-gel method and characterized through techniques such as X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. The photocatalytic reaction was monitored using UV-Vis spectroscopy and gas chromatography.
