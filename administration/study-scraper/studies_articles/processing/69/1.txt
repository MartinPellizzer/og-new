The methodology involved selecting 42 teeth with endodontic treatment and a degree of dental saturation equal to or greater than A2. The teeth were divided into two groups: PNaS (sodium perborate + saline solution) and PNaOZ (sodium perborate + ozone sunflower oil with 16 ppm). The color GS was evaluated at the beginning of treatment and 7 days after the end of treatment, using the Vita classical color scale.
