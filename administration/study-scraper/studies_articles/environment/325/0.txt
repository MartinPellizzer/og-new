The depletion of the ozone layer has become a global environmental concern, threatening the health and well-being of humans and ecosystems. Human activities, particularly the release of ozone-depleting substances (ODS), have led to the thinning of this protective layer over recent decades. The illegal trade in ODS has emerged as a significant challenge, posing economic, health, and environmental risks. This paper aims to explore the legal dimensions surrounding ODS, their impact on the ozone layer, and the subsequent risk of skin cancer.
