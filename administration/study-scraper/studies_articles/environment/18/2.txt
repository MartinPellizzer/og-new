The results show that Taiwan has made significant progress in reducing ODS consumption. The phase-out of CFCs, CCl4, halon, and CH3CCl3 was achieved prior to 2010. HCFC emissions declined from 1,933 kilotons of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2eq) in 1993 to 373 kilotons CO2eq in 2022. HFC emissions increased initially but have since decreased, with a baseline consumption reduction target of 80% by 2045.
