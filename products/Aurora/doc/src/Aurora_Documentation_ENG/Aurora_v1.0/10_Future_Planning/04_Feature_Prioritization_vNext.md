Got it ‚úÖ ‚Äî what you‚Äôre describing is essentially a **Feature Requirements / Prioritization Document** for the *next version of Aurora*.

This type of document helps you:

* Define **which features matter most** for the upgrade,
* Show stakeholders **why they‚Äôre important**, and
* Provide a roadmap for development and implementation.

Here‚Äôs a professional structure you can use:

---

# Aurora Next-Generation Feature Prioritization Document

## 1. Introduction

* Purpose of the document (guide feature development for Aurora vNext)
* Target audience (engineering, product management, investors, compliance officers)
* Scope (features under consideration for next release, excluding long-term roadmap items)

---

## 2. Summary of Current Capabilities

* Brief overview of what the current Aurora system already delivers

  * Core sanitization functions
  * Hardware/software integration
  * Safety compliance
* Identified gaps or limitations in the current version

---

## 3. Feature Prioritization Framework

* **Criteria for prioritization:**

  * Regulatory compliance requirements
  * Customer demand / market pull
  * Operational efficiency gains
  * Technical feasibility
  * Cost vs. ROI
* **Prioritization tiers:**

  * Tier 1: Critical / Must-have
  * Tier 2: High-value / Should-have
  * Tier 3: Nice-to-have / Future consideration

---

## 4. Proposed Features for Next Version

### Tier 1 ‚Äì Critical Features

1. **Enhanced Ozone Leak Detection**

   * Multi-point sensor arrays with redundancy
   * Faster shutdown response
2. **Regulatory Reporting Dashboard**

   * Automatic generation of OSHA/EPA/ISO compliance reports
   * Export in PDF/CSV for audits
3. **Multi-Zone Sanitization Control**

   * Independent control of multiple rooms/areas from one unit
   * Optimized scheduling across facility zones

### Tier 2 ‚Äì High-Value Features

1. **AI-Powered Cycle Optimization**

   * Machine learning models to minimize cycle time while maximizing kill rates
2. **Mobile App Integration**

   * Remote monitoring and control from iOS/Android
3. **Energy Optimization Mode**

   * Adjusts ozone generation based on off-peak energy hours
   * Tracks energy savings

### Tier 3 ‚Äì Future Considerations

1. **Voice Command Support**

   * Hands-free operation for operators in clean environments
2. **Augmented Reality (AR) Maintenance Assistant**

   * AR-guided repair/maintenance procedures
3. **Blockchain-Backed Audit Trail**

   * Tamper-proof logging for regulated industries

---

## 5. Feature Impact Analysis

* **Table of features vs. benefits** (e.g., safety, compliance, cost savings, user adoption)
* **Estimated development effort** (high/medium/low)
* **Implementation timeline** (short, medium, long term)

---

## 6. Risks and Dependencies

* Technical risks (sensor availability, cloud infrastructure)
* Compliance risks (new standards in review)
* Resource dependencies (R\&D, third-party suppliers)

---

## 7. Recommended Roadmap

* **Aurora v2.0 (Next Release):** Deliver all Tier 1 + select Tier 2 features
* **Aurora v2.1 (Minor Update):** Add remaining Tier 2 features
* **Aurora v3.0 (Future):** Incorporate Tier 3 innovations

---

üëâ This structure gives you a **clear, decision-ready document** that‚Äôs useful for both engineering teams (to build) and stakeholders (to approve investment).

Would you like me to **fill this outline with suggested ‚Äúreal‚Äù features for Aurora v2.0** based on what‚Äôs trending in industrial sanitization tech (IoT, AI, predictive maintenance, stricter compliance)? That way you don‚Äôt just have the structure, but also strong content ideas.
