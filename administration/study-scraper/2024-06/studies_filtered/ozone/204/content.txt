Abstract
Nitrogen oxide radicals (NOx≡NO+NO2) emitted by fuel combustion are important precursors of ozone and particulate matter pollution, and NO2 itself is harmful to public health. The Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS), launched in space in 2020, now provides hourly daytime observations of NO2 columns over East Asia. This diurnal variation offers unique information on the emission and chemistry of NOx, but it needs to be carefully interpreted. Here we investigate the drivers of the diurnal variation in NO2 observed by GEMS during winter and summer over Beijing and Seoul. We place the GEMS observations in the context of ground-based column observations (Pandora instruments) and GEOS-Chem chemical transport model simulations. We find good agreement between the diurnal variations in NO2 columns in GEMS, Pandora, and GEOS-Chem, and we use GEOS-Chem to interpret these variations. NOx emissions are 4 times higher in the daytime than at night, driving an accumulation of NO2 over the course of the day, offset by losses from chemistry and transport (horizontal flux divergence). For the urban core, where the Pandora instruments are located, we find that NO2 in winter increases throughout the day due to high daytime emissions and increasing NO2/NOx ratio from entrainment of ozone, partly balanced by loss from transport and with a negligible role of chemistry. In summer, by contrast, chemical loss combined with transport drives a minimum in the NO2 column at 13:00–14:00 local time (LT). Segregation of the GEMS data by wind speed further demonstrates the effect of transport, with NO2 in winter accumulating throughout the day at low winds but flat at high winds. The effect of transport can be minimized in summer by spatially averaging observations over the broader metropolitan scale, under which conditions the diurnal variation in NO2 reflects a dynamic balance between emission and chemical loss.

1 Introduction
The Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS) satellite instrument was launched in February 2020 by the National Institute of Environmental Research (NIER) to observe air quality over East Asia. GEMS is the first geostationary instrument directed at air quality and provides hourly column measurements of several gases including nitrogen dioxide (NO2) (J. Kim et al., 2020). NO2 is part of the nitrogen oxides (NOx≡NO+NO2) radical family, which is emitted by fuel combustion and whose chemistry plays a critical role in driving ozone (O3) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) formation. NO2 itself is of concern as an air pollutant. Loss of NOx is by atmospheric oxidation by the hydroxyl radical (OH) and ozone, resulting in a lifetime of a few hours in summer and about a day in winter (Shah et al., 2020). The diurnal cycle of NO2 measured from geostationary orbit offers unique information on the emission, chemistry, and transport of NOx. Here we interpret the GEMS observations with the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model (CTM) to better understand the processes controlling this diurnal cycle.
Several studies have examined the diurnal variation in NO2 in urban air using surface concentrations from air quality networks. The data typically exhibit bimodal maxima in the morning around 07:00–09:00 local time (LT) and in the evening around 19:00–21:00 LT, including over Beijing and Seoul (Cheng et al., 2018; H. C. Kim et al., 2020). This has been commonly attributed to high NOx emission during morning and evening rush hours (Kendrick et al., 2015; Cheng et al., 2018), but urban NOx emission inventories show little variation during daytime (Miao et al., 2020). Moutinho et al. (2020) found that the morning and evening NO2 maxima could be driven by shallow mixing depths in contrast to the middle of the day and afternoon hours when surface heating maximizes the mixing depth. This diurnal maximum in mixing depth defines the planetary boundary layer (PBL) in daily contact with the surface. The PBL depth extends typically to 1–3 km altitude.
Ground-based measurements of NO2 columns are available from the Pandora sun-staring spectrometer instrument network used for validating satellite observations (Herman et al., 2009; Kanaya et al., 2014; Judd et al., 2020; Verhoelst et al., 2021). Column measurements integrate concentrations from the surface to the top of the atmosphere and are therefore not directly sensitive to mixing depth. The Pandora network consists mainly of urban sites, where the NO2 column and its variability are mainly within the PBL (Yang et al., 2023). The Pandora data from Seoul tend to show an increasing trend in the early morning followed by flat concentrations over the rest of the daytime, with less diurnal variation than NO2 concentrations in surface air (Crawford et al., 2021). Nearby sites can show different diurnal variations, pointing to a major role of local transport in driving this variation (Chang et al., 2022; Kim et al., 2023).
Satellite observations of NO2 from polar sun-synchronous low-earth orbit (LEO) have been made since 1995 starting with the GOME instrument (Martin et al., 2002) but observe by design at a single time of day. Several studies have combined observations from the SCIAMACHY or GOME-2 instruments observing in the morning at 09:00–10:00 LT and the OMI instrument observing in the afternoon at 13:00–14:00 LT to get some information on NO2 diurnal variation. Boersma et al. (2008) found decreases from morning to afternoon over urban regions that they attributed to photochemical loss, as well as increases from morning to afternoon over tropical biomass burning regions that they attributed to a midday maximum in emissions. Boersma et al. (2009) found that the urban morning-to-afternoon decrease was largest in summer and absent in winter. Penn and Holloway (2020) found that NO2 column ratios between morning and afternoon were lower than surface NO2 concentration ratios, as would be expected from deeper vertical mixing in the afternoon. Ghude et al. (2020) found an important role for transport in driving morning-to-afternoon variations in NO2 columns over urban India. Edwards et al. (2024) found that the diurnal variation in the NO2 column from GEMS in June is driven by photochemistry at a regional scale and variability in emissions and meteorology at a local scale.
Here we analyze and compare the NO2 diurnal cycles observed by GEMS over the Seoul and Beijing metropolitan areas in winter and summer. We compare them to the diurnal cycles observed by Pandora in the urban cores and to simulations with the GEOS-Chem CTM. We use GEOS-Chem to separate and quantify the roles of emission, chemistry, and transport in driving the NO2 diurnal cycles observed from GEMS over different spatial scales. This work provides a basis for a more quantitative application of GEMS observations as top-down information on NOx emissions and more generally for interpreting the diurnal cycle of NO2 from geostationary orbit with application to the TEMPO instrument over North America launched in April 2023 (Zoogman et al., 2017) and the Sentinel-4 instrument over Europe to be launched in 2024 (Gulde et al., 2017).
2 Observations and model
2.1 GEMS data
GEMS is an ultraviolet–visible instrument measuring backscattered solar spectra at 300–500 nm (J. Kim et al., 2020). It was launched in February 2020 in geostationary orbit at a longitude of 128.25° E. We use hourly total NO2 slant column density from the GEMS L2 NO2 version 2.0 product at native 3.5 × 8 km2 resolution for December–February (DJF) 2021/22 and June–August (JJA) 2022 (https://nesc.nier.go.kr/; NIER, 2023). The GEMS NO2 algorithm uses differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS) to fit backscattered solar spectra within the 432–450 nm range (J. Kim et al., 2020). This yields the slant column density along the light path (L2 data). We use all GEMS L2 NO2 version 2.0 data that pass algorithm quality flag ≤ 112, final algorithm flag ≤ 1, solar zenith angle (SZA) < 70°, viewing zenith angle (VZA) < 70°, and cloud fraction < 0.3 (Lee et al., 2020).
The vertical column density of NO2 is obtained by dividing the slant column density by an air mass factor (AMF) characterizing the photon path from the sun down through the atmosphere and back up to the instrument. The AMF depends on the viewing geometry and on the scattering properties of the atmosphere.

w(z)S(z)dz
Here TOA is the top of the atmosphere, AMFG is the geometric AMF defined by the solar zenith angle (SZA) and the satellite viewing angle (VZA) as AMFG= sec(SZA) + sec(VZA), w(z) is the scattering weight that defines the instrument's sensitivity to NO2 at altitude z, and S(z) is a normalized vertical profile of NO2 number density called the shape factor (Palmer et al., 2001). Scattering weights are calculated with a radiative transfer model and increase with altitude (Martin et al., 2002; Yang et al., 2023). The shape factor is usually estimated with a CTM.
An alternative DOAS retrieval and AMF by Lange et al. (2024) improved the GEMS L2 NO2 version 2.0 vertical column density product, which was biased due to using incorrect vertical profiles for AMF computation (Oak et al., 2024). Here, we use our own AMF. We use scattering weights at 448 nm compiled as a lookup table dependent on SZA, VZA, relative azimuth angle (RAA), surface albedo, cloud top pressure, and effective cloud fraction (Park and Kwon, 2020). We specify the shape factor with local NO2 concentrations from the GEOS-Chem simulation described in Sect. 2.3 and extending to the mesosphere. In simulations of observations from the KORUS-AQ aircraft campaign over South Korea, Yang et al. (2023) showed that GEOS-Chem was successful in reproducing the NO2 vertical profile observed below 5 km altitude and inferred from NO observations above. They found that the PBL extending to 2 km altitude accounted for over 95 % of the NO2 tropospheric column and 80 %–91 % of the total NO2 atmospheric column in the Seoul and Beijing metropolitan areas of interest here. The model correctly simulated the observed diurnal variation in the PBL NO2 vertical profile over Seoul as driven by mixed layer growth. This resulted in a diurnal amplitude of 14 % for the AMF, peaking in the afternoon when mixing depth is maximum.
2.2 Pandora data
The Pandora instruments measure radiance at 280–525 nm (Herman et al., 2018) and fit total column NO2 (including the stratosphere). There were two Pandora sites in Seoul and one in Beijing (40.0° N, 116.4° E) for the 2021–2022 period. The two Pandora sites in Seoul are at Seoul National University (Seoul – SNU; 37.5° N, 127.0° E) in the southern part of Seoul (Kim et al., 2021; Park et al., 2018) and at Yonsei University (Seoul – YSU; 37.6° N, 126.9° E) in the northern part of Seoul (Kim et al., 2017). The Beijing site is located on the north side of Beijing and a more detailed description is in Liu et al. (2024). We obtain the Pandora direct sun data from the Pandonia global network (http://pandonia-global-network.org; PGN, 2023). We exclude low-quality data (quality flag = 12) as recommended by PGN (2021).
2.3 GEOS-Chem model
We use GEOS-Chem CTM version 13.3.4 (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5764874, The International GEOS-Chem User Community, 2021) driven by assimilated meteorological data from the Goddard Earth Observing System – Forward Processing (GEOS-FP) with a horizontal resolution of 0.25° × 0.3125° (≈ 25 × 25 km2) over East Asia (24–52° N, 104–133° E) and 3-hourly boundary conditions from a global GEOS-Chem simulation with
