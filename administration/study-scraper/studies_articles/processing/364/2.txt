The results showed a gradual fading of color in the dyed wool samples as they aged, with significant changes in the CIE Lab parameters and overall color difference (Î”E) observed. Yellow dyes were found to be the most light-sensitive, while red dyes aged faster. The SEM analysis revealed morphological changes, such as fiber fragmentation and surface roughening, while FTIR spectroscopy detected alterations in the molecular structure of the wool fibers.
