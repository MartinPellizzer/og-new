The removal of micropollutants from wastewater is a pressing concern due to their potential harm to both human health and the environment. Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs) have been widely employed for this purpose, showcasing significant efficiency in degrading pollutants. However, traditional AOPs often rely on ozone production and light sources, which consume substantial energy. This not only raises environmental concerns but also increases operational costs, making large-scale implementation challenging. To address these limitations, a novel technology integrating magnetic nanocomposites with photocatalysis has been developed to optimize micropollutant removal from wastewater.
