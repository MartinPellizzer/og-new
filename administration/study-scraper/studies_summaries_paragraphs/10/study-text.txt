Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the study's findings related to ozone:

The study employed four spectrometric techniques to investigate the effects of chlorination and ozonation on effluent organic matter (EfOM) from a wastewater treatment facility. Results showed that ozone exhibited superior oxidizing properties compared to chlorine, as revealed by ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm (UVA254) and fluorescent excitation-emission matrix (EEM) analyses. Ozone-induced changes in EfOM led to more diverse structural modifications, whereas chlorination resulted in less extensive transformations. Protein-like substances were found to be the most susceptible to both oxidants, with distinct reaction sequences observed for each. Furthermore, the study highlights the importance of considering specific organic matter variations in real-world EfOM samples compared to model substances. The findings provide insights into the reactivity and transformation of organic matter in wastewater treatment processes using simple and rapid spectroscopic methods, potentially improving the management and mitigation of undesired byproducts.
