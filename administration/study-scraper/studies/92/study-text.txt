Abstract
Background
Ozone is often used as an additive therapy for skin conditions like infectious diseases, wound healing, diabetic foot, and pressure ulcers. The viability of the nasal skin has crucial importance in revision rhinoplasty cases. The study investigates the potential benefits of medical ozone therapy in healing the nasal skin in multiple-operated cases.
Methods
The study retrospectively examined 523 revision rhinoplasty patients operated by the first author from January 2017 to January 2024. Patients consenting to ozone therapy received 3 major autohemotherapy sessions post-surgery. Patients were divided into 2 groups: those with compromised nasal skin (infection, poor vascular supply) and those with normal healing. Age, gender, smoking, diabetes, previous surgeries, grafting materials, and techniques were considered.
Results
Of the 523 patients, 12 (2.3%) experienced major skin complications like infection and necrosis, while 511 (97.7%) had no or minor issues, such as discoloration. In total, 301 patients accepted and received ozone therapy. Of the patients without major complications, 299 (58.3%) received ozone therapy, while 212 (41.7%) did not. Among the 12 with major complications, two (16.7%) received ozone therapy, and the remaining 10 (83.3%) did not. Ozone therapy recipients showed statistically fewer skin problems (p<0.05). Costal cartilage as tip and septal extension graft was linked to skin issues (p<0.05). No major adverse effects from ozone therapy were noted.
Conclusions
Our findings indicate that ozone therapy may be a safe and potentially effective option for patients undergoing revision rhinoplasty, especially those with compromised nasal skin. It appears to aid in skin healing and regeneration, possibly through enhancing oxygen delivery and modulation of the immune response. Ozone therapy is a promising adjunct treatment for managing skin complications in revision rhinoplasty patients.
