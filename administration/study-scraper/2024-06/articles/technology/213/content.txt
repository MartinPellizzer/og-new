Here are the five detailed paragraphs based on the scientific study:

**Paragraph 1**
Introduction
Control of Contaminants of Emerging Concern (CECs) is a crucial aspect in water reuse and treatment processes. Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs) have been recognized as effective methods for removing CECs from wastewater effluents. This study aimed to investigate the control of CECs during pilot-scale AOPs for water reuse, focusing on UV- and ozone-based AOPs for the removal of selected CECs present in real wastewater.

**Paragraph 2**
Methods
The study was conducted using a pilot plant installed downstream of two different wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) designed for water reuse. Two AOP processes were investigated: UV/H2O2 and O3/H2O2. The removal efficiency (RE) of selected CECs was discussed considering their photo-susceptibility, reactivity with •OH, and ozone (O3). Fluorescence spectroscopy was performed on collected samples to obtain excitation/emission matrices (EEMs).

**Paragraph 3**
Results
The results showed that the RE of selected CECs varied between 60% and 100% during UV/H2O2 process in WWTP-1 effluent, while for O3 and O3/H2O2 processes, the RE ranged from 0% to 100%. Fluorescence spectroscopy revealed that the removal of the microbial/tryptophan-like region was highly correlated with the removal of micropollutants. The results also highlighted the effectiveness of AOPs in removing CECs, including pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs).

**Paragraph 4**
Discussion
The study's findings indicate that AOPs can be an effective tool for controlling CECs in wastewater treatment processes. The removal efficiency of selected CECs was influenced by their photo-susceptibility, reactivity with •OH, and ozone (O3). Furthermore, the results suggest that fluorescence spectroscopy can be used as a surrogate parameter to monitor the removal of micropollutants in real-time.

**Paragraph 5**
Conclusion
In conclusion, this study demonstrated the potential of UV- and ozone-based AOPs for controlling CECs in wastewater treatment processes. The findings highlight the importance of considering photo-susceptibility, reactivity with •OH, and ozone (O3) when evaluating the removal efficiency of selected CECs. Future studies should focus on scaling up these AOP processes and exploring their applicability in various wastewater treatment settings.
