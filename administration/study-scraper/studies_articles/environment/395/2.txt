The retrieved ozone profiles agreed with data from SCIAMACHY v3.5 within -10%-5%, except at an altitude of 45 km, where the bias became larger (approximately -15%). The comparison with OSIRIS v7.1 showed differences within ±10% for 30-53 km altitude. The errors were mostly less than -5% below 43 km compared with ACE-FTS v4.0, but there was a large negative deviation in the upper stratosphere.
