notes general: 
- ozone more stable pH < 7, over 7 decomposes
- ozone more stable and soluble at lower temperature, more reactive at higher
  temp
- ozone has more bactericidal effect at RH 90-95%, no effect < 50% 
- ozone decreses the more organic matter there is
- aqueous ozone seems more effective than gaseous on food microorganisms
- longer exposure times and higher concentrations needed for gas than water
- gas longer half-life and better diffusion

=======================================================
needs high ozone levels and long exposure times

korany et al. [101]
	material: polystyrene
	vessel: water
	1.0 ppm for 1 min: 0.9 log reduction
	2.0 ppm for 1 min: 3.4 log reduction
	4.0 ppm for 1 min: 4.14 log reduction
	lowr reduction with multi-strain biofilms and with organic matter

robbins et al. [102]
	complete elimination of strain cells after 4 ppm of ozone

nicolas et al. [103]
	gas, 45 ppm, 1h, stainless steel, redux 3.41 cfu/cm2, (L.
monocytogenes)
	same but biofilm more resistant

harada et al. [104]
	gas, 45 ppm, 5min, polypropylene dry, L., < 1.7 log
	gas, 45 ppm, 5min, stainless steel dry, L., redux 3.4 log

recent experiment [26]
	gas, 50 ppm, 6h, decrease biofilm mass 59%
	only slight redux of live cells in biofilm

de candida et al. [27]
	cold gas, low concentration, glass, polypropylene, stain-less steel,
expanded polystyrene, continuous flow 1.07 mg m-3, after 24/48h cold
incubation, inactivation of 11 strains, 
	best res, inoculum levels 9 cfu coupon-1, 48h, 3.21 mg m-3, stainless
steel and expanded polystyrene

baumann et al [105]
	0.25 ppm, 0.5 ppm, 1.0 ppm, + ultrasound in 250 ml of potassium
phospathe buffer, 30/60s, combined treatment more effective than individual
treatments, redux 7.31 cfu/ml after 60s at 0.5 ppm.
