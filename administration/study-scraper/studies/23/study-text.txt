Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic impacted the solar power industry, business, and supply chain for 2019–2021, and installations are falling behind the mission plan. However, Indian PV manufacturers see it as a chance to engage in solar manufacturing to establish a competitive, sustainable, and robust domestic solar industry instead of import-based installations. Given the country's current environmental concerns, green and sustainable local manufacturing is the only viable alternative. By conducting a life cycle assessment (LCA), this study compared the environmental impacts generated by the five most promising photovoltaic technologies-mono-silicon, polysilicon, copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS), cadmium telluride (CdTe), and passivated emitter and rear contact (PERC) solar modules considering manufacturing in India. The study utilizes the ReCiPe method supported by Ecoinvent 3 databases and Simapro V9.0 software, and the functional unit for the data collection is in ‘per square meter’, which is later converted to ‘per kWh’ standard for comparison with the existing studies. The system boundary selected is from cradle to gate. The results demonstrate that cadmium telluride (CdTe) is the best technology for Indian climatic conditions in terms of environmental impact, with a global warming potential of 0.015 kg CO2 eq/kWh, stratospheric ozone depletion of 5.41E-09 kg CFC11 eq/kWh, human carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic toxicity of 6.67E-04 kg 1,4-DCB/kWh and 1.48E-02 kg 1,4-DCB/kWh, respectively and fine particulate matter formation of 3.96E-05 kg PM 2.5 eq/kWh assuming a lifetime of 25 years for these modules. CIGS follows CdTe in almost every environmental impact category.

1. Introduction
Solar energy harvesting is playing an increasingly important role in the global energy transition, with installed solar capacity in 2023 exceeding the combined capacity of some other renewable energy technologies like wind, biomass etc. Developing countries such as India have also made significant efforts in this direction over the last decade to ensure the continued growth of the solar energy sector to meet out the growing population's ever-increasing energy demands. In this regard, solar power capacity in India has increased from 1 GW in 2012 to 61.97 GW as of November 30, 2022, while the Levelized cost of energy for solar power has decreased from Rs. 17 in 2010 to Rs. 2.44 in 2019 [1 USD ∼ 46 INR (2010); 1 USD ∼ 72 INR (2019)] (
Agency, 2006
) (
IRENA, 2019
). The installed capacity has surpassed 40 GW as of October 2022 (
MNRE. Current Status | Ministry of New and Renewable Energy and Government of India, 2020
).
Fig. 1
depicts a graphical representation of the cumulative installed capacity in MWs and module cost (INR/Wp) for the period 2010–2020 (

MNRE. Current Status | Ministry of New and Renewable Energy and Government of India, 2020
).
During these years (2010–2020), India, the world's fastest-growing country with a population of around 1.4 billion people, was on the path of energy transformation with many plans in place (
Reece, 2003
). The government aggressively pursued clean energy installations, investment, and clean energy for decarbonization to meet the commitments of the Paris and Copenhagen climate agreements. For this purpose, the government has implemented several solar schemes, some of which are listed in
Table 1
.
Table 1. Major initiatives taken by the Indian government to encourage the installation of solar photovoltaic panels (
Schemes | Ministry of New and Renewable Energy and Government of India. Governmen of India, 2022
).
Scheme Year Mission
Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission 2015 The objective of this solar scheme is to establish India as a global leader in the solar sector by creating the policy conditions. The Mission has set the ambitious target of deploying 20 GW of grid-connected solar power by 2022, which was revised to 100 GW by 2022 during June 2015.
Development of Solar Park Scheme 2014 MNRE proposes the financial assistant by the government to establish and facilitate the infrastructure for setting up solar parks in various states with capacity greater than 500 kW. It proposes the development of at least 25 parks with capacity of minimum 20 GW.
SECI scheme 2011 The main objective is to engage in the development of large scale and rooftop solar projects, channelize the investment in the government sector, implement MNRE and VGF schemes, project management consultancy and trading of solar power. SECI has also played a major part in installing rooftop solar power plant.
With these schemes, India experienced a significant increase in solar installations until 2019 and early 2020, when COVID-19 hit India. Before the pandemic, 2020 was expected to be a growth year for India's solar installations. However, the scenarios have changed in the last two years (mid-2020 to early 2022) due to the pandemic effect, and continuous regression in the solar power sector has been observed. The COVID-19 outbreak affected the global solar supply chain of solar equipment. India imports more than 80% of its solar cells and modules and other manufacturing equipment such as raw materials, inverters, BOS equipment, etc. (
Hairat and Ghosh, 2017
) (
Pimpalkhare, 2020
). According to CRISIL reports, this caused a delay in installing approximately 3 GW of solar projects in India with a net worth of INR 160 billion, which were scheduled to be installed in 2020 (
CRISIL, 2020
). As a result, the pandemic has caused several setbacks for this sector, lowering India's installation estimates by 26 % for 2020 (
BRIDGE TO INDIA
).
However, as the saying goes, “every problem has an equal or greater opportunity." This is also significant for the Indian solar power sector, as according to a report, solar equipment imports fell by 79 % between April and October 2020, compared to the same period last year (
India's Solar Import
). The decrease in imports presents an opportunity for Indian solar manufacturers. Manufacturers see opportunities to invest in the production of solar cells and modules. To encourage domestic manufacturing, the government, on the other hand, has imposed tariff and non-tariff barriers, such as a safeguard duty on solar cells and imported modules (
India's solar cells
). Other steps taken to promote solar manufacturing as part of the 'Self Reliance India' and 'Make in India' plans include the Special Incentive Package Scheme (M-SIPS), preference for local suppliers, the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme, domestic content requirements, and many more (
India's solar cells
).
Due to net-zero commitments made at COP-26, many countries have expressed interest in solar PV manufacturing beginning in mid-2021 (
Shiradkar et al., 2022
). India is also pursuing green and sustainable manufacturing of solar cells to improve supply chain reliability (to mitigate disruptions similar to that occurred during the pandemic), increase energy security, and decarbonization. Aside from being economical, reducing environmental impacts during manufacturing is essential. This, in turn, will contribute to achieving the United Nations seventh Sustainable Development Goal (SDG), 'affordable and clean energy'.
Various LCA studies related to PV systems have been collected and examined in this direction.
Table 2
summarises these studies, including the technology used, the functional unit (FU), methodology, system boundaries, objective, findings etc. According to the literature, most studies are on mono-silicon and polysilicon, with global warming potential (GWP) and energy payback time (EPBT) as the most commonly evaluated impact categories (
Zhong et al., 2011
). Other important impact categories, such as human toxicity, human health, ozone depletion, etc., were almost entirely ignored in most literature (
Alizadeh and Avami, 2021
). Furthermore, among various technologies, literature on PERC technology is almost non-existent irrespective of its high conversion efficiency. Therefore, the evaluation of each technology in the solar energy for Indian scenarios is necessary and will further pave the road for implementing these technologies for various extended innovations in the field such as agri-photovoltaics (
Hamidinasab et al., 2023
) (
Ghasemi-Mobtaker et al., 2020
) etc.

Considering the preceding discussion, this paper investigated the novel and dominant solar PV technologies in the Indian market, focusing on environmental analysis. Going in the depth of the environmental concerns of solar PV, these sources are indeed clean and environment friendly compared to fossil fuels, but only during their operational phase. It cannot be considered completely free of environmental impacts throughout its life cycle because environmental concerns are severe during the manufacturing and use phases (
Yıldız et al., 2020
). PV modules from first-generation technologies, mono-silicon, and polysilicon, necessitate using metals and glass, which consume significant energy during mining and manufacturing (
Aşkın et al., 2023
). Second-generation thin film technologies (CIGS and CdTe) use hazardous chemicals and heavy metals, which must be handled carefully to avoid widespread release into the environment (
Giurco et al., 2019
). As a result, a proper strategy for efficient and environment-friendly use of this abundant source of solar energy is required to make it effective in mitigating the impacts of global climate change and fossil fuel emissions. The need for analysing environmental indicators of PV technologies arises from the same. This must also be updated regularly, even if only minor improvements in technology design are made, to determine the overall effect.
The National Solar Mission of the Indian government has benefited the Indian solar industry. India's solar module manufacturing is also rapidly expanding. Although solar module electricity generation is environmentally friendly, producing solar modules emits greenhouse gases, pollutes the air and water, and depletes resources. Economic growth, as well as social and environmental considerations, are required for sustainable development. The LCA of solar module technologies may assist in identifying the most sustainable one that balances economic, social, and environmental benefits. LCAs of solar module technologies in the context of Indian manufacturing can demonstrate their environmental impact and suggest ways to reduce the impact of solar energy production. Policymakers can boost the low-carbon economy and reduce the environmental impact of solar energy by promoting the most sustainable technologies. Hence, this study evaluates the following objectives.
•
To study the environmental impacts of the five solar energy technologies: Mono-silicon, Polysilicon, Copper Indium Gallium Selenide (CIGS), Cadmium Telluride (CdTe) and Passivated Emitter and Rear Contact (PERC) using Indian manufacturing conditions.
•
The study calculated the Life cycle impact from cradle-to-gate analysis of these five solar PV technologies using Life Cycle Assessment tool.
•
A comprehensive comparison of these technologies on an environmental scale based on Indian climatic conditions to identify their environmental hotspots for future improvements.
The analysis provided may assist policymakers, researchers, and industry stakeholders in India in making informed decisions on the deployment of PV technology and environmental policies. Determining solar technology with lesser environmental consequences and the reasons behind it might provide valuable guidance for future research and development endeavours. Additionally, it may offer manufacturers and investors with valuable information on the most environmentally friendly choices in which they can spend their resources for innovation and have a positive influence on society. This research may also aid in developing a comprehensive cradle-to-grave evaluation, particularly when recycling poses a difficulty in the industry. Moreover, the results could help formulate policies that advocate for the advancement of more environmentally friendly and energy-efficient photovoltaic technologies and practices, therefore assisting India in achieving its environmental and energy objectives.

2.1. Goal and scope
This study compares and contrasts the life cycle assessments of five solar technologies: mono-silicon, polysilicon, CIGS, CdTe, and PERC. The consequential analysis is carried out to quantify the environmental impact of these technologies, and the comparative analysis is carried out to compare this impact across technologies to determine which technology has the advantage. The FU is set to 'per square meter' for this analysis, which means that data is collected for 1 square meter of solar module manufacturing.

2.3. Life cycle impact assessment
The method of life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) is used to convert inventory data from various stages of the life cycle into a set of potential impacts. The impact assessment method used in this LCA is the ReCiPe method, which is supported by Ecoinvent 3 databases and Simapro V9.0 software. The ReCiPe H midpoint method recognises eighteen impact categories, which include Global warming (GW) (kg CO2 eq), stratospheric ozone depletion (SOD) (kg CFC11 eq), ionizing radiation (kBq Co-60 eq), ozone formation human health (kg NOx eq), fine particulate matter formation (kg PM2.5 eq), ozone formation terrestrial ecosystems (kg NOx eq), terrestrial acidification (kg SO2 eq), freshwater eutrophication (kg P eq), marine eutrophication (kg N eq), terrestrial ecotoxicity (kg 1,4-DCB), freshwater ecotoxicity (kg 1,4-DCB), marine ecotoxicity (kg 1,4-DCB), human carcinogenic toxicity (kg 1,4-DCB), human non-carcinogenic toxicity (kg 1,4-DCB), land use (m2a crop eq), mineral resource scarcity (kg Cu eq), fossil resource scarcity (kg oil eq) and water consumption (m3) (
CML - Department of Industrial Ecology, 2016
).

Looking at each technology individually for the environmental analysis, the major contribution in the case of mono-silicon and polysilicon photovoltaic modules (refer to
Fig. 4
,
Fig. 5
) is due to the mono-silicon and polysilicon cells. These cells contributed more than 50 % for most impact categories, such as global warming, stratospheric ozone depletion, ionizing radiation, fine particulate matter formation, eutrophication, fossil resource scarcity, and water consumption. Other than the effect from cell, copper and aluminium alloys shows a huge influence in impacts. Aluminium alloy scores 53 % in human carcinogenic toxicity, whereas copper added 63 % in human non-carcinogenic toxicity. For other impact categories, along with aluminium alloy and copper, solar glass and electricity contributed noticeably. The polysilicon photovoltaic module shows similar results as produced for the mono-silicon module.
For CIGS laminate (
Fig. 6
), electricity consumed during manufacturing plays a major role in environmental impacts. For ionizing radiation, electricity contributes 89.4 % - the highest among impact indicators. In global warming, ozone depletion, fine particulate matter formation, eutrophication, human carcinogenic toxicity, human non-carcinogenic toxicity, and fossil resource scarcity, electricity scores 66.2 %, 65.2 %, 64 %, 74.5 %, 70.8 %, 50.7 % and 62.4 % respectively. Molybdenum contributes significantly to the 66.1% scarcity of mineral resources. Low iron solar glass and uncoated flat glass also contributed significantly to the production of CIGS laminates. Aluminium alloy contributes significantly to each impact category when laminating a panel. Similarly to CIGS, electricity played the most important role in the production of CdTe (
Fig. 7
), with the highest contribution in ionizing radiation (94.8 %). Furthermore, solar glass and uncoated flat glass have a high impact in nearly every impact category.
Single silicon cells significantly contribute to every impact category for the PERC module (see
Fig. 8
). In addition, copper contributed significantly to ecotoxicity (60 %) and human non-carcinogenic toxicity (76.9 %). Solar glass with low iron contributes only marginally to all impact categories. Electricity also plays a minor role in the PERC module manufacturing process. Metallization paste used in PERC cell manufacturing positively impacts impact categories such as non-carcinogenic human toxicity (-69.4 %) and freshwater ecotoxicity (-47.8 %).
The 'per square meter' of module produced values as shown in
Table 9
are converted into 'per kWh' of electricity generation for a better comparison of these technologies with the existing literature (refer to
Table 10
). The following equation was used to perform the conversion (
Sarialtin et al., 2020
):
(1)
where,
is the impact produced per meter square (refer
Table 9
), I is the solar irradiation,
is module efficiency (assumed as 75% of cell efficiency), A is the active area (area defined by the mask or the area where solar light falls), PR is the performance ratio, and LT is the lifetime. The values taken for I,
, A and PR are given in
Table 3
. The value of LT is assumed as 25 years for the calculation done in
Table 10
.

The findings in
Table 10
for impacts generated 'per kWh of electricity production' are consistent with Bergesen et al.'s findings that CdTe and CIGS have comparable environmental and resource impacts (
Bergesen et al., 2014
). Similar to Collier et al., electricity used is the major contribution of emission for CdTe (
Collier et al., 2014
). Additionally, CdTe is expected to emit fewer GHGs than CIGS, which is in line with the presented study where CdTe has a global warming of 0.015 kg CO2 eq, and CIGS has a global warming of 0.032 kg CO2 eq (
Bergesen et al., 2014
). The global warming value for other modules such as mono-silicon, polysilicon, and PERC are 0.044, 0.041and 0.043 kg CO2 eq, respectively. The global warming values for all studied PV technologies lie in the range of 0.029 and 0.050 kg CO2-eq per kWh of electricity produced, which is consistent with the one given by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) and existing literature (
Peng et al., 2013
) (
Pacca and Horvath, 2006
).
Other than global warming, other important impact categories to be studied here are stratospheric ozone depletion, human carcinogenic toxicity, human non-carcinogenic toxicity, and fine particulate matter formation.

4. Conclusions, limitations, and future directions
This study investigates the environmental impact of the five dominant technologies in relation to the manufacturing location of India: monosilicon, polysilicon, CIGS, CdTe, and PERC. The study looked at eighteen environmental impact categories, including major ones like global warming, stratospheric ozone depletion, human carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic toxicity, and the formation of fine particulate matter. The analysis was carried out using a cradle-to-gate life cycle approach, it began with raw material extraction and ended at the factory's exit gate. Hence, the analysis only considers the material and manufacturing stages. The Indian energy mix was used to calculate the environmental impact of manufacturing. According to the analysis, CdTe has the lowest environmental impact of the five technologies studied, with a GWP of 0.015 kg CO2 eq per kWh, stratospheric ozone depletion of 5.41E-09 kg CFC11 eq per kWh, human carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic toxicity of 6.67E-04 kg 1,4-DCB per kWh and 1.48E-02 kg 1,4-DCB per kWh, respectively and fine particulate matter formation of 3.96E-05 kg PM2.5 eq per kWh assuming a lifetime of 25 years. CdTe technology is followed by CIGS to produce the least environmental impact. This research will be useful in determining which technology will dominate the Indian market if the entire manufacturing occurs only in the Indian region so that the investors can invest in identifying the environmental hotspots identified by this analysis and improve the environmental performance of these technologies.
Additionally, the limitation of the current research is that it only examines a cradle-to-gate analysis of the five solar technologies owing to constraints in the information available. This method encompasses the environmental impacts of extracting raw materials all the way to the solar panel manufacturing for the use phase. Nevertheless, this research only includes part of the life cycle of solar technologies since it excludes the recycling and gate-to-grave phases which encompass the use, disposal, and recycling of the product.
Future studies might explore the potential benefits of including the gate-to-grave period. By using the same methods used in this study, researchers have the potential to expand the investigation to include the recycling phase. This would provide a more thorough evaluation of the environmental impacts linked to various solar technologies during the recycling phase or the whole life cycle. An expansion of this nature has the potential to provide vital knowledge about the sustainability of these technologies. Additionally, the researchers might explore the social life cycle assessment or life cycle cost analysis for these technologies for exploring the social and economic side of manufacturing of these technologies.
