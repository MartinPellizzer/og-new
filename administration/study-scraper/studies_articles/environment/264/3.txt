The findings of this study provide new insights into ozone pollution control in urban areas. By decoupling meteorological factors, the authors were able to identify the impact of local emissions on O3 formation and highlight the importance of considering transport and dispersion in air quality modeling. The results also suggest that emission reduction measures should be tailored to specific meteorological conditions to achieve effective O3 pollution control.
