Here is a summary of the study in one paragraph:

The study investigated non-methane volatile organic compound (NMVOC) sources and sinks in England and Scotland, UK. The results showed that NMVOC concentrations were higher at urban sites, particularly Marylebone and Eltham, compared to rural sites Chilbolton and Auchencorth. Ethane and propane emissions from vehicles and industries had a significant impact on ozone formation, with contributions ranging from 4% in Eltham to 8% in Chilbolton. The potential source contribution function (PSCF) indicated that Marylebone and Eltham were influenced by local traffic sources, while Chilbolton and Auchencorth had VOC sources from wider geographical areas. Overall, the study highlights the importance of understanding NMVOC emissions to inform strategies for reducing ozone formation in urban areas.
