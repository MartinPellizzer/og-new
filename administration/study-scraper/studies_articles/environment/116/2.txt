The results showed that elevated O3 concentration significantly reduced the stem height, tiller number, and panicle weight per stem of rice. The pushing resistance of rice at harvest was also substantially decreased under E-O3, by 32% in intact plants and 18% in single stems. Almost all of the determined parameters for basal internode traits, including breaking resistance, bending moment, culm wall thickness, cross-sectional area, and dry weight per unit length, were decreased under E-O3. In contrast, warming treatment had no discernible influence on tiller number but significantly decreased stem height and single panicle weight.
