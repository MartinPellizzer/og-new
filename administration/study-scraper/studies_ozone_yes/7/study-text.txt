Abstract
The present long-term study has been conducted with dual objectives: firstly, to monitor the spatio-temporal variation of ambient air quality parameters and secondly, to evaluate the impact of air pollutants on the Delhi population. Five years (January 2019 to December 2023) of data of six key pollutants (PM10, PM2.5, NO2, O3, Benzene, and Toluene) were collected by continuous ambient air quality monitoring stations, obtained from the Central Pollution Control Board portal. The impact of air pollutants on human health was assessed using different indices and the AirQ+ model developed by the World Health Organization (WHO). Additionally, the ozone formation potential (OFP) of benzene and toluene was evaluated. The findings of the study revealed that the concentrations of PM10 and PM2.5 exceeded both national and global guidelines across all the sites throughout the study period. Notably, industrial sites were classified as the severe category according to the National Air Quality Index. At industrial sites, the OFP of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) was observed to be higher in comparison to commercial sites. The AirQ+ model analysis in the health risk assessment indicated a strong association between PM10 exposure and mortality from respiratory (91.36%) and chronic bronchitis (90.85%) diseases. Additionally, long-term PM2.5 exposure was linked to an increased risk of stroke (65%) and circulatory (63.83%) mortality.

Environmental significance
Long-term study to assess the impact of air pollution on human health in Delhi, the capital city of India (fastest emerging economy of the world). The concentrations of particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) exceeded the Indian and WHO ambient air quality standards. Concentrations of volatile organic compounds (benzene and toluene) were significant at the industrial sites. A health risk assessment using the AirQ+ model demonstrated a significant association between PM10 exposure and mortality, predominantly attributed to chronic bronchitis and respiratory diseases in the Delhi region.

1. Introduction
Exposure to environmental pollutants has been associated with chronic diseases and mortality, posing a major threat to public health.1,2 Recently, the prevalence of air pollution-associated diseases has increased on local, regional, and global scales. The majority of anthropogenic air pollutants are derived from vehicular and industrial emissions, fossil fuel combustion, mining activities, cooking fuels, and construction works.3,4 These sources form a complex mixture of toxic pollutants such as particulate matter (PM) and air pollutants including nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and ozone. Several lines of evidence (epidemiological and clinical studies) have demonstrated that air pollutants exert deleterious effects on human health including systemic inflammation, elevated peripheral blood pressure, cardiovascular events, hypercoagulability, and may alter the cardiac autonomic nervous system.1,5–7 However, the exact mechanisms by which pollutants exert these effects are not fully understood.
Every year, air pollution accounts for 7 million deaths due to joint effects of ambient and household air pollution, impacting 99% of the global population living in areas that exceed World Health Organization guidelines.8,9 Particulate Matter (PM) serves as a key component of air pollution, categorized by its aerodynamic size. Fine particles such as PM2.5 possess the ability to penetrate deep into the respiratory system. Therefore, they contribute to a wide range of health effects including pulmonary and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.10 Several studies all over the world have demonstrated that the particulate matter released by vehicles poses a significant risk to our environmental health.11 Factors such as high urban population, an increasing number of motor vehicles, traffic density, and vehicle characteristics are severely exacerbating the impact of atmospheric pollutants on the urban environments.12,13 In developing countries like India, solid fuels such as coal or biomass are the major fuel sources used for cooking and heating. These activities result in the emission of hazardous gases such as nitrogen oxide, sulphur oxides, carbon monoxide, ammonia, ozone, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs).14,15 In the atmosphere, VOCs play an important role in the formation of ozone (O3). BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene) react with atmospheric nitrate and hydroxyl radical to form aldehydes, peroxyacetyl nitrates (PAN), and secondary aerosols. BTEX has been identified as a hazardous substance by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). Among them, benzene poses a significant concern to human health due to its carcinogenic properties.16
Particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) are indispensable criteria pollutants to assess the ambient air quality of any region and to calculate the Air Quality Index (AQI). Also, significant concentrations of particulate matter were observed in the city in past studies.17–20 Prominent sources of nitrogen dioxide in the ambient air are vehicular and industrial emissions and higher concentrations signify anthropogenic activities. Also, NO2 acts as a precursor of tropospheric ozone (ground-level ozone), which causes serious environmental and health hazards.21–27 Earlier studies have shown the adverse impact of benzene and toluene on human health.28 Therefore, these six air pollutants (PM10, PM2.5, NO2, O3, benzene, and toluene) were considered for the present study.
Delhi, the capital of India, has been declared as one of the most polluted city globally by the World Health Organization (WHO).29 Based on PM2.5 concentration, the latest IQ Air report has ranked Delhi as the most polluted capital city among 106 countries. Previous studies have identified the large transport sector, which has the highest vehicle stock in the country, as a major source of emissions.30 It has experienced dramatic growth in traffic density due to the increased rate of new vehicle production and extended industrial sectors, contributing as a primary source of ambient air quality in Delhi.31 Though, the Government has formulated and implemented a variety of measures to address pollution including compressed natural gas (CNG) for public transport vehicles, implementation of Bharat Stage (BS) norms for public and private vehicles, regular monitoring to check fuel adulteration, promotion of e-mobility, etc.18,32–36 The previously reported studies are fragmented and short-term with limited pollutants. Thus, the present long-term study aimed to investigate the impact of air pollution on human health in the Delhi region. To assess the risk, we have measured the six potent air pollutants at four different Delhi regions and predicted the health risk. These findings lend support to the view that air pollution is linked with serious harmful effects on human health which further contributes to the global burden of diseases.
2. Materials and method
2.1. Study region
Delhi city (28.61 °N and 77.23 °E, 216 m above mean sea level), the capital city of India is spread over 1484 sq. km and caters to over 32 million population. According to the Koppen classification, the city's climate is a humid subtropical climate with a dry winter (Cwa).37 The Indian Meteorological Department categorically divides Delhi's seasons into winter (January–February), pre-monsoon (March to May), summer-monsoon (June–September), and post-monsoon (October–December) seasons.25 The city witnesses extreme temperatures between winter (5 °C to 10 °C) and summer (45 °C or more) seasons. River Yamuna, Indo-Gangetic alluvial plains, Delhi Ridge (green cover), and Aravalli hill ranges are the geographical characteristics of the city, where around 21.86% of the geographical area is forest-covered. Delhi-National Capital Territory (Delhi-NCT), borders with the neighboring states (Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Rajasthan), and is collectively known as Delhi-National Capital Region (Delhi-NCR). Researchers have earlier mentioned that the total road length in Delhi is 33198 km with 864 signalized and 418 blinkers traffic intersections, forming 1749 km road density (road length per 100 km2). Delhi has different clusters of residential/institutional, industrial, and commercial establishments with other hotspots having high traffic interjections. The city has witnessed a continuous rise in vehicular density and different industrial units over the past few years (Tables ST1 and ST2†) (ESI†).20,31,38 Delhi comes among the most polluted cities in the world, being the most degraded urban air quality.39,40
2.2. Study period and parameters
In this long-term study, twenty-four-hour ambient air quality data of six pollutants (PM10, PM2.5, NO2, ozone (O3), benzene, and toluene) were downloaded from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) portal (https://www.airquality.cpcb.gov.in/ccr/#/login) from January 01, 2019 to December 31, 2023 (sixty-months). The above-said data are being collected by real-time continuous ambient air quality monitoring stations (CAAQMS) established at different locations in the city by the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC). PUSA (S1) and Okhla Phase II (S4) are categorized as industrial sites as these sites have clusters of industrial units of various scales. National stadium (S2) lies in the central part of the city where various govt. organizations, departments, and establishments are situated. Similarly, Dwarka Sector 8 (S3) is a suburban area of the city that has observed tremendous infrastructural and commercial growth in the recent past. Sites S2 and S3 fall under the commercial category as these regions have residential and commercial complexes, education institutions, hospitals, govt. offices etc. All the selected sites for the present study witness dense traffic load, interjections, and large population density. The details of the sampling stations and studied parameters are given in Table 1. Ozone, benzene, and toluene were considered to assess the impact assessment on human health in the present study. The present study investigates the ozone formation potential of VOCs and assesses the health risks posed by the studied parameters on human health.

PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations were analyzed by Beta Ray Attenuation Method (BAM 1020/Spirant BAM 1020; Met One, USA/Ecotech, Australia) while nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations were analyzed with the Chemiluminescence method (Serinus 44; Ecotech Australia).20 It's important to note that Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Stations (CAAQMS) were temporarily closed for maintenance at various locations for several days throughout the study period. We have factored these closures into our calculations. AirQ+ software tool for health risk assessment of air pollution was downloaded from World Health Organization (WHO) (https://www.who.int/europe/tools-and-toolkits/airq---software-tool-for-health-risk-assessment-of-air-pollution). Origin Pro 2022 was used for graph plotting (Fig. 1).

2.3. Ozone formation potential
Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are important reactants for photochemical smog and ozone formation. The reaction between the OH radical and VOCs produces aryl peroxy radicals, which react with NO to form NO2 and aryloxy radicals. Nitrogen dioxide acts as a precursor of ozone, contributing to the formation of O3 in the ambient atmosphere. Degradation of aryloxy radicals also helps in the formation of ozone. The ozone formation potential (OFP) has been calculated using the following equation:
OFP = MIR coefficient × C
where, MIR is the maximum incremental reactivity scale and C is the ambient concentration (μg m−3) of VOC. The MIR coefficient
