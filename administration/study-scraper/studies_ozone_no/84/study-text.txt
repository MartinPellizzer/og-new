Abstract
For the first time, an energy-efficient and eco-friendly technology for the conversion of abundantly available kitchen waste, specifically waste cooked rice water (WCRW) to drop-in- biofuels, namely, butyl levulinate (BL), has been explored. The synthesis of BL was accomplished employing butyl alcohol (BA) and WCRW in an energy-efficient UV (5W each UVA and UVB)-near-infrared (100W) irradiation assisted spinning (120 rpm) batch reactor (UVNIRSR) in the presence of TiO2-Amberlyst 15 (TA15) photo-acidic catalyst system (PACS). The optimal 95.81% yield of BL (YBL) could be achieved at 10 wt% catalyst concentration, 60 °C reaction temperature, 80 min time, and 1:10 WCRW: BA concentration as per Taguchi statistical design. Moreover, additional combination of different PACS such as TiO2-Amberlyst 16, TiO2-Amberlyst 36, and TiO2-Amberlite IRC120 H rendered 86.72% YBL, 90.04% YBL, and 93.47% YBL, respectively, proving superior efficacy compared to individual activity of the acidic catalysts and photocatalysts. The heterogeneous reaction kinetics study for TA15 PACS suggested Langmuir–Hinshelwood model to be the best fitted model. A significant 63.33% energy could be saved by UVNIRSR as compared to conventional heated reactor at the optimized experimental condition using PACS TA15. An overall alleviation in environmental pollution with 59.259% reduction in GWP, 15.254% decline in terrestrial ecotoxicity, 18.238% diminution in marine ecotoxicity, 17.25% decrease in ozone formation affecting human health, 5.865% reduction in human non-carcinogenic toxicity, 18.65% diminution in ozone formation affecting terrestrial ecosystem, 55.17% significant decrease in terrestrial acidification, and 25.619% mitigation in fresh water ecotoxicity could be observed. Furthermore, BL-biodiesel-diesel blends (3% BL, 7% biodiesel, and 90% diesel) exhibited significant reduction (25.45% and 36%, respectively, for CO and HC) in harmful engine exhaust emissions demonstrating environmental sustainability of the overall process.
