The findings suggest that Pandora data users should re-examine their approach to data analysis, considering the potential usefulness of all quality flags rather than solely relying on high-quality data. The independent uncertainty filter provides a valuable tool for researchers seeking to maximize the use of Pandora observations in scientific applications. Furthermore, this study highlights the importance of accounting for biases between direct-sun and sky-scan modes when combining datasets.
