The researchers employed an experimental design using artificial semiconductor wastewater with an initial concentration of 100 μM TMAH. The O3/PMS process was conducted at various temperatures (25-50°C) and pH levels (5.0-9.0). A scavenger test was performed to confirm the contribution of hydroxyl radicals (•OH) in the degradation process. Additionally, the effects of alkalinity and humic acid on the degradation efficiency were investigated.
