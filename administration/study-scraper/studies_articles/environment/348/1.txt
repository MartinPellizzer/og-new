The research employed a simplified model based on lumped variables, including initial ozone demand, two classes of organic matter (slow and fast reacting), radical forming and ozone-decomposing compounds, radical scavengers, and a hypothetical target contaminant. The model was developed by incorporating detailed reactions networks and then simplifying the resulting equations using sensitivity analysis techniques. The model parameters were estimated using a combination of experimental data and prior knowledge.
