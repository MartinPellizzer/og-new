Here is a summary of the study in 1 detailed paragraph, focusing on information and data related to ozone:

A new deconvolution method for broadband ultraviolet-visible absorption spectra has been developed to simultaneously measure eight species, including ozone (O3), reactive nitrogen species (RNS) and their precursors. This method enables the processing of broadband spectra to overcome instrumental limitations and accurately analyze high-density O3 and RNS in atmospheric-pressure plasma applications. The study demonstrates the efficacy of this method through two case studies: NO2 and N2O4 equilibria, and reactive species produced by a surface dielectric barrier discharge. The measured densities of O3 agree well with theoretical and experimental results, with detection limits on the order of ppmv achieved at a short path length of 15 cm. This spectral analysis method has great potential for real-time monitoring of O3, NOx, and RNS in various scientific research and industrial applications involving atmospheric pressure plasmas.
