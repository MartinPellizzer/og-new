Ozonation and UV irradiation are promising sustainable methods for extending the shelf life of stored fruits. Cranberries, also known as American cranberries (Vaccinium macrocarpon Ait.), are a species of evergreen shrubs native to North America. They are well-known for their large, tart, and red berries. The aim of this research was to evaluate the effectiveness of a constructed system enabling simultaneous ozonation and UV-C irradiation of cranberry fruits in extending their shelf life.
