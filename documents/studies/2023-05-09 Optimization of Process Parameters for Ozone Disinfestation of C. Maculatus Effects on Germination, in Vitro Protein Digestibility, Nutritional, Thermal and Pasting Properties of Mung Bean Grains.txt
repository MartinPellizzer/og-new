---------------------------------------------------

problem:
	ozone in food processing eco-friendly and cost-effective for pest control and grain quality improvement
	control Callosobruchus maculatus on Mung bean

experiment:
	500-1000 ppm
	2-6 h
	grain moisture content 11-15%
	control egg, larvae, pupae, adults of Callosobruchus maculatus
	Mung bean tested in-vitro protein digestibility (IVPD), grain hardness, and germination rate
	influence on proximate and mineral analysis, thermal and pasting properties

result:
	C. maculatus pupae and adults were least susceptible to ozonation
		with mortality rates of 11.11 and 13.04–100%, respectively
	in optimal conditions (11.17% moisture, 1000 ppm, 2 h), mortality rate:
		egg: 104.07%
		larvae: 90.15%
		pupae: 86.82%
		adults: 83.55%
	values:
		IVPD: 67.85%
		hardness: 57.43 N
		grain germination: 87.74%

	noticeable decrease in protein, fat, and mineral content
	enhancement in thermal and pasting properties
		

objective:
	ozone can be utilized to develop high quality grain products, while ensuring their safety
