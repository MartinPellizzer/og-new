Short-Lived Climate Forcers (SLCF) have gained significant attention in recent years due to their substantial impact on climate change and human health. SLCF substances such as black carbon, methane, tropospheric ozone, and hydrofluorocarbons have a short lifetime in the atmosphere and contribute to global warming. This study aims to provide basic data for establishing countermeasures against ozone pollution in the agricultural sector, particularly in Korea.
