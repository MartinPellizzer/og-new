Surface ozone (O3) pollution is a significant environmental health concern in China. With rapid urbanization and industrialization, O3 levels have been increasing over the past two decades. This study aims to investigate the changes in surface O3 concentrations across different regions in China during this period. By using advanced fine-scale estimations, we can better understand the spatial and temporal patterns of O3 pollution and its implications for environmental health.
