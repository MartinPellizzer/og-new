Here is a summarized version of the study in 1 paragraph, focusing on information and data related to ozone:

The study investigated the effectiveness of a constructed system combining ozonation with UV-C irradiation for post-harvest processing of cranberry fruits (Vaccinium macrocarpon Ait.) to reduce storage losses. The system, consisting of an ozone chamber and UV-C radiation sources, was designed to treat large cranberries continuously. Ozone gas was generated at a rate of 240 g/h, and UV-C radiation sources emitted 20 W/m² of intensity. Results showed that the combined process of ozonation and UV-C irradiation reduced microbiological load by 3.4 log cfu−1, extending shelf life and reducing storage losses by 8.98% in mass compared to the control group. The system also contributed to a reduction in water loss and limited fruit losses by approximately 5% during storage, making it a sustainable and environmentally friendly solution for cranberry production.
