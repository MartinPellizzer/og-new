Short-term exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone (O3) has been linked to increased mortality risk in various studies. However, the joint effect of coexposure to these two pollutants remains poorly understood. A recent study conducted by Chang Xu et al. aimed to investigate the synergistic effect of PM2.5 and O3 on mortality in China using a multicity time series approach. The study analyzed data from 272 cities over three years, providing valuable insights into the interaction between these two major air pollutants.
