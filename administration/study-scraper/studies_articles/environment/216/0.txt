The impact of climate change is becoming increasingly apparent in regions such as the Middle East, where hotter temperatures and drier weather are becoming more prevalent. As a result, near-surface UV radiation is also increasing, posing significant health risks to humans and other living organisms. Estimating UV radiation doses on a regular basis is crucial for protecting individuals against excessive UV radiation outdoors, particularly in populous areas such as Tehran.
