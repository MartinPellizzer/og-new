The increased ILSS values can be attributed to the enhanced functional groups on the surface of the carbon fibres, which improved their interfacial bonding with the matrix. The roughening of the fibre surfaces also contributed to this improvement. These findings suggest that ozone treatment is an effective method for enhancing the interfacial properties of carbon fibres.
