Discussion (100 words)The study demonstrates the potential of ozone UFBW as a novel approach for degrading bacterial toxins. The results suggest that OUFBW not only sterilizes bacteria but also degrades bacterial toxins, which can cause diseases even after bacterial sterilization. This technology has significant implications for the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases, particularly in low- and middle-income countries where access to antibiotics is limited.
