The methods used in this study include routine ground-based measurements of TOC and ozone profile soundings at two stations, Hohenpeissenberg and Berlin/Potsdam/Lindenberg. The measurements were taken using various instruments, including Brewer spectrophotometers and ozone sondes. The data was then analyzed to determine long-term changes in stratospheric ozone and temperature.
