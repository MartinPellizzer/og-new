The study used a unique dataset from five Indian cities to analyze the relationship between air pollution and labor productivity in call centers. The data was collected over a period of one year and included information on daily ambient air pollution concentrations, as well as various indicators of labor productivity such as call volume, average handling time, and quality metrics. The researchers employed a regression analysis approach to control for other factors that might influence the relationship between air pollution and productivity.
