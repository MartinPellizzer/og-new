Effluent organic matter (EfOM) is a crucial component in water treatment systems, and its reactivity to oxidants such as chlorination and ozonation is essential for evaluating the effectiveness of these processes. Understanding the changes in EfOM composition and structure during oxidation is vital for assessing potential environmental impacts and human health risks. This study aimed to explore the effects of chlorination and ozonation on EfOM using advanced spectroscopic techniques.
