In conclusion, this study has provided valuable insights into the sources and sinks of non-methane volatile organic compounds in England and Scotland, UK. The results highlight the importance of traffic-related emissions as a source of VOCs in urban areas and suggest that wider geographical areas contribute to VOC emissions in rural regions. Further research is needed to fully understand the complex interactions between NMVOCs, O3 formation, and their impact on air quality and climate change.
