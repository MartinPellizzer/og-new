In conclusion, this study demonstrates the significant impact of land use patterns on air pollution in the western area of Tehran. The results suggest that industrial areas and high-traffic density zones are major sources of pollutants, while green spaces and low-density residential developments can act as natural buffers against pollution. By incorporating health buffers into urban planning strategies, cities can reduce exposure to air pollution and create healthier environments for their residents.
