The research methods employed in this study involved analyzing data on geomagnetic index Ap, total ozone content (TO), and COVID-19 cases from January 1, 2020, to May 1, 2021. The researchers obtained daily values of Ap and TO for this period and compared them with the incidence of COVID-19 around the world during the same time frame. This allowed them to investigate any potential correlations between these variables.
