ABSTRACT

One
 of
 our
 era’s greatest courgesis air pollution, on
 account not only of its impact on climate

change but also its impact on public and individual health due to increasing morbidity and

mortality. There are many pollutants that are major factors in disease in humans.
 Among them,

Particulate Matter (PM), par
ticles of variable but
 very small diameter, penetrate the respiratory

system via inhalation, causing respiratory
 and cardiovascular diseases, reproductive and central

nervous system dysfunctions, and cancer. Despite the fact that ozone in the stratosphere
 plays a

protective role against ultraviolet irradiation, it is harmful when in high
 concentration at ground

level,
 also affecting the respiratory and
 cardiovascular system. Further
 more, nitrogen
 oxide,

sulfurdioxide,
 Volatile
 Organic
 Compounds
 (VOCs),
 dio
xins
 ,and
 polycyclic
 aromatic

hydrocarbons (PAHs) are all considered air pollutants that are harmful to humans. Carbon

monoxide can even provoke direct poisoning when breathed in at high levels. Heavy metals

such as lead, when absorbed into the human body,
 can lead to direct
 poisoning or chronic in

toxication, depending on exposure. Diseases occurring from the
 a fore
 mentioned substances

include principally respiratory problems such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease

(COPD), asthma, bronchiolitis, and also lung cancer,
 cardiovascular events, central nervous

system dysfunctions, and cutaneous diseases.
 Last but no
t least, climate change resulting from

environmental pollution affects the
 geographic al
l
 distribution of many infectious diseases, as do

natural disasters. The only way to tackle this problem is through public awareness coupled with a

multi disciplinary
 a
pproach by scientific experts; national and international organizations must

address he
 emergence of this threat and propose sustainable solutions.

 APPROACH TO THE
 PROBLEM

The interactions between humans and their physical surroundings have been extensively

studied, as multiple human activities influence the environment. The environment is a coupling

of the biotic (living organisms and microorganisms) and the abiotic
 (hydrosphere, lithosphere,

and atmosphere).
 Pollution is defined as the introduction into the environment of substances

harmful to humans and other living organisms. Pollutants are harmful solids, liquids, or gases

produced in higher than usual concentrat
ions that reduce the quality of our environment.
