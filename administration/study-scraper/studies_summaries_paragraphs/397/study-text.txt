Here is a summary of the study in 1 detailed paragraph, focusing on the information and data related to ozone:

The study examined the characteristics of surface ozone pollution and its correlations with meteorological factors in Xiangtan from 2020 to 2022. The results showed significant increases and notable seasonal variations in daily maximum 8-h average ozone concentrations (O3-8h) during this period, with an average O3-8h concentration of 124.6 μg/m³. The ozone and temperature change response slope (KO3-T) indicated that local emissions had no significant effect on O3-8h generation. Analysis revealed a polynomial distribution between average O3-8h concentrations and maximum temperatures (Tmax), with an increasing trend at Tmax < 27 °C, followed by a downward trend at Tmax > 37 °C. Relative humidity (RH) was found to play a crucial role in O3 pollution, with the primary range for exceedance of the standard value being 45-65%. Wind speed (WS) and dominant wind direction were also significant factors, with O3-8h concentrations increasing rapidly at WS < 1.5 m/s and decreasing slowly above 2 m/s. Overall, this study highlights the importance of understanding the complex relationships between ozone pollution and meteorological factors to effectively mitigate its negative impacts on air quality and public health.
