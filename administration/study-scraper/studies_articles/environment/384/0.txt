Ozone (O3) concentration temporal cycles in Arizona have been a subject of interest in recent years, particularly regarding the impact of human activities on O3 fluctuations. Understanding these fluctuations is crucial for developing effective control strategies aimed at reducing O3 exceedances in the region. This study aims to advance insights on O3 concentration temporal cycles in Arizona by examining differences between weekdays and weekends, as well as during five distinct seasons.
