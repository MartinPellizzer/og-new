Taiwan's regulatory actions were joint-ventured with central competent authorities, aiming to reduce ODS consumption. The industry adopted alternative technologies and substances, leading to a decline in the consumption of CFCs, CCl4, halon, and CH3CCl3 prior to 2010. Emissions of HCFCs and methyl chloride showed significant declines over the past three decades. HFC emissions, however, exhibited a V-type variation due to local production and extensive use.
