The disposal of infectious medical waste poses a significant threat to public health and the environment. The improper management of this type of waste can lead to the spread of diseases and harm to both human and animal populations. Therefore, it is essential to develop effective methods for disinfecting infectious medical waste. Ozone technology has been proposed as a promising approach for the disinfection of medical solid waste, but its feasibility and effectiveness need to be evaluated.
