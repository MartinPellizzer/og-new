Abstract
This study refines the Bird model for forecasting solar radiation on oriented and inclined surfaces in Southern Tunisia, known for its high solar potential. Integrating the model into an Excel tool simplifies radiative transfer equations, enhancing solar forecast precision and accessibility. Over a decade of meteorological data enriches the model with atmospheric parameters like aerosol optical depth, water vapor content, and ozone thickness, extending its applicability across unmonitored regions. The improved model achieves coefficient of Determination (R²) values of 0.989 for Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI), 0.969 for Direct Horizontal Irradiance (DHI), and 0.974 for Diffuse Horizontal Irradiance (DifHI), with reduced Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values of 24.66 W/m² for GHI, 36.59 W/m² for DHI, and 12.66 W/m² for DifHI. Optimal panel inclinations are 40° to 60° in winter, 10° to 30° in summer, and 30° to 40° in spring and autumn for maximum solar energy capture. These findings enhance the understanding of solar dynamics in arid regions and support strategic solar energy deployment, offering a scalable framework for similar environments globally and promoting sustainable energy development.

Introduction
Solar radiation forecasting is crucial within the renewable energy landscape, underpinning the optimization of solar power systems' performance and reliability. Accurate predictions of solar irradiance are essential for effective planning and operation of photovoltaic (PV) installations, which directly influence energy management and economic returns in the solar energy sector
[1]
,
[2]
. Furthermore, precise forecasting is vital for integrating solar energy smoothly into power grids and managing the intermittency of renewable energy sources, thereby bolstering the stability and efficiency of energy systems
[3]
.
In arid regions like Southern Tunisia, known for their high solar potential due to abundant sunshine and minimal cloud cover, solar radiation forecasting faces specific challenges and opportunities
[4]
. While these regions hold significant promise for solar power generation, they also encounter specific environmental challenges such as high-temperature variability and frequent dust events, which can impair the efficiency of solar panels
[5]
. In such contexts, accurate solar irradiance predictions are indispensable for maximizing the utility of solar installations, thus ensuring sustainable energy development that is adapted to local conditions.
The methodologies employed in solar irradiance forecasting are diverse and tailored to various environmental and technical requirements. Traditional models often utilize empirical and statistical approaches based on historical weather data to predict future solar conditions, favored for their applicability in regions with extensive climatic records

Despite their precision, many of these sophisticated models necessitate complex calculations and substantial computational resources, which limits their accessibility primarily to specialists. To address these limitations, there has been significant progress in simplifying these models without compromising their accuracy. The R.E. Bird model, renowned for its efficacy in clear sky conditions, is particularly advantageous for arid regions like Southern Tunisia. This model calculates direct and diffuse solar radiation by incorporating multiple atmospheric parameters such as air mass, ozone absorption, and water vapor content

This study aims to bridge the research gap by enhancing the forecasting of solar radiation on oriented and inclined surfaces in Southern Tunisia, employing a novel adaptation of the R.E. Bird model integrated into 'Excel Software'. This innovative tool simplifies complex radiative transfer equations, improving forecasting accessibility and accuracy specifically tailored to the specific atmospheric conditions of the region. By addressing the distinct challenges and leveraging the high solar potential of Southern Tunisia, this research seeks to optimize the configuration and efficiency of both photovoltaic and concentrated solar power systems in arid climates. The development of Excel represents a pivotal advancement in solar irradiance forecasting technology, particularly suited for regions like Southern Tunisia where it can significantly contribute to harnessing the full potential of solar energy.
Methodology
Characterization of the study area: Tataouine, Southern Tunisia
The focus of this research is Tataouine, located in the arid yet sun-drenched landscapes of Southern Tunisia. Situated at a latitude of 32.997 degrees, a longitude of 10.451 degrees, an elevation of 210 m, and within the +1-hour time zone, Tataouine offers a specific setting for studying solar phenomena. Characterized by its exceptional solar exposure, the region boasts a wide range of annual solar irradiance, oscillating between 1800 and 2800 kWh/m²
[24]
. This spectrum underscores Tataouine's robust potential for solar power generation and earmarks it as a prime locale for renewable energy exploration. The variation in solar irradiance levels provides critical insights necessary for the development and optimization of tailored solar energy infrastructures.
At the heart of this study is the meticulous examination of solar insolation in Tataouine — the quantum of solar energy received per unit surface area, which significantly influences the performance and design of solar power systems. To afford a holistic overview, we've incorporated a set of maps titled "Exploration of Solar Energy Potential in Tataouine, Tunisia: Geographical Location and Irradiance Profiles" (

By delineating solar energy availability with enhanced precision, the study affirms Tataouine’s crucial role in the sustainable energy narrative, setting a solid base for upcoming endeavors in solar energy harnessing and application.
To address the specific atmospheric challenges of Southern Tunisia, the methodology includes adjustments in the solar irradiance forecasting models to account for dust accumulation and temperature variability. Instruments like high-precision pyranometers are employed to measure the impact of dust on solar irradiance directly, while temperature sensors help correlate fluctuations with changes in panel efficiency.
Data collection and instrumentation
The presented study utilized weather data collected over 10 years, from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2020, in Tataouine, Tunisia, and leveraged data from a state-of-the-art meteorological station equipped with high-precision instruments critical for solar radiation research. This array included Kipp & Zonen CHP1 pyrheliometers and CMP21 pyranometers, which offer exceptional accuracy in measuring direct solar irradiance and hemispherical irradiance, respectively, along with Campbell Scientific CS215 probes for detailed temperature and relative humidity readings. Additionally, NRG instruments provided precise wind speed and direction measurements. This ensemble of instruments, validated through regular recalibrations against international standards and documented in
Table 1
