The results show that the robot can irradiate an area of 0.98-1.04 square meters in just 14.76 seconds, using a radiated energy of 4.5382 Joules per meter squared and 30 Watts of power per lamp. The calibration of the MQ-131 and MQ-135 sensors allows the system to automatically turn off after disinfection, avoiding contamination of the environment.
