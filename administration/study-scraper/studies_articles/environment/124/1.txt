To explore this relationship, the authors used a random forest method to estimate O3 exposure levels for participants from the Henan Rural Cohort. Longitudinal IR markers were assessed using homeostasis model assessment-IR, quantitative insulin sensitivity check index, and triglyceride and glucose index. The role of relative telomere length (RTL) in associations between O3 exposure and longitudinal IR markers was examined using generalized linear models and quantile regression models.
