Here is a summarized paragraph focusing on the data related to ozone:

A mathematical model was developed to study the cerium redox process for surface removal of stainless steel components using a static mixer as a gas-liquid contactor. The model accounted for the reduction of Ce(IV) by steel components and oxidation of Ce(III) by ozone in the presence of nitric acid. Experimentally validated, the model revealed that increasing gas flow rate, liquid flow rate, ozone concentration, initial nitric acid concentration, and solution volume favor a desired flat Ce(IV) concentration profile in the loop. In contrast, increasing temperature and component surface area led to a decline in equilibrium Ce(IV) concentration. The study found that reducing acidity of nitric acid limits treatment time, and that using Ce(III) or Ce(IV) salt as a cerium ion source has no effect on metal corrosion when ozone regenerates Ce(IV).
