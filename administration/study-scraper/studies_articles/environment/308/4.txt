In conclusion, this study provides new insights into long-term changes in surface O3 concentrations over the North China Plain. The results suggest a complex interplay between VOCs and NOx emissions and highlight the need for targeted control measures to reduce O3 pollution. Further research is necessary to fully understand the underlying causes of O3 trends in the NCP and to develop effective strategies for mitigating this important air quality issue.
