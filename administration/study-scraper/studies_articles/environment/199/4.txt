In conclusion, the study highlights the importance of considering the interplay between nitrogen oxides and ground-level ozone when developing air quality policies in London. Further research is needed to investigate the ozone weekend effect, seasonal influences, and the impacts of urban heat islands and climate change on air quality. Targeted policies or regulations could be informed by these findings to improve air quality in London. The study's results have significant implications for environmental scientists, policymakers, and stakeholders seeking to mitigate the negative effects of air pollution on public health and the environment.
