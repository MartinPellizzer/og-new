The discussion highlights the importance of understanding the mechanisms behind O3 formation, particularly in urban areas where VOC emissions are high. The study suggests that POCP can be a useful tool for air quality modeling and policy-making, as it allows policymakers to prioritize control measures on the most potent VOCs. Additionally, the study underscores the need for further research into the chemical processes involved in O3 formation, in order to develop more accurate predictive models.
