The Velkhover-Chizhevsky phenomenon is a well-known relationship between solar activity and the incidence of mass diseases worldwide. This phenomenon was first discovered by Russian scientist A.L. Chizhevsky, who found that the number of mass diseases tends to increase before and after the peak of solar activity. The purpose of this study is to investigate the role of the Velkhover-Chizhevsky phenomenon in the relationship between vertical solar-terrestrial connections. Specifically, we aim to explore the connection between geomagnetic indices, total ozone content, and the incidence of COVID-19 worldwide.
