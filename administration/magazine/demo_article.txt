The application of ozone in water treatment has long relied on a framework based on ozone exposure (Ct) to validate disinfection processes. Despite its historical use, recent research indicates that significant viral inactivation can occur with minimal or undetectable ozone exposure. This finding highlights the complexity of ozone disinfection, which is influenced by numerous water quality parameters and the specific methods used for calculating and measuring ozone levels.

Our study explored alternative frameworks for monitoring ozone in water treatment, as well as the effects of water quality variables on ozone decay kinetics and the inactivation of viruses and coliform bacteria. Notably, we discovered that both changes in UV254 absorbance and the ratio of applied ozone to total organic carbon (O3
) were strongly correlated with viral inactivation. These frameworks proved resilient against variations in water quality, suggesting their robustness for practical applications.

Temperature and pH were found to significantly influence ozone decay rates. Specifically, increasing the temperature from 12 to 30°C and the pH from 5.5 to 8.4 accelerated the ozone decay rate, reducing the resulting ozone exposure by up to 90% in the case of pH. However, because the reaction rate of ozone with viruses also increased at higher temperatures and pH levels, the overall disinfection performance experienced only a minor decline—around 20% in the case of pH—for a given O3
ratio.

The study also considered source waters with varying levels of total organic carbon (TOC) and total suspended solids (TSS). For these waters, the change in UV254 absorbance and the applied ozone dose (mg/L) were the most reliable indicators of disinfection performance. Nevertheless, site-specific testing may be necessary to adapt this framework to different water sources effectively.

An important finding was the significant impact of influent nitrite on ozone disinfection performance, with a more than 50% reduction in viral inactivation observed in the presence of nitrite. This underscores the critical need to account for nitrite levels when determining the appropriate ozone dose. Additionally, multi-point ozone dissolution emerged as a promising alternative application method, potentially enhancing overall disinfection performance, particularly in the presence of nitrite.

Developing and validating these alternative monitoring frameworks and ozone application methods is crucial, especially in water reuse scenarios where excessive ozone exposure can lead to the formation of harmful byproducts. Our findings advocate for a more nuanced approach to ozone disinfection, emphasizing the need for adaptable and resilient monitoring strategies to ensure safe and effective water treatment.
