The integration of UGS-BVOC and land use cover changes (LUCC) in air quality models notably enhanced surface monthly mean O3 predictions by 3.6-8.0 μg/m3 (+3.8-8.5%) and contributed up to 18.7 μg/m3 (+10.0%) to maximum daily 8-hour average (MDA8) O3 levels during O3 pollution episodes. Additionally, UGS-BVOC emissions alone increased monthly mean O3 levels by 2.2-3.0 μg/m3 (+2.3-3.2%) in urban areas and contributed up to 6.3 μg/m3 (+3.3%) to MDA8 O3 levels during O3 pollution episodes.
