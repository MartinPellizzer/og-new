The IASI instrument on board Metop-A, -B, and -C satellites has been measuring Earth's radiance in the thermal infrared range since 2007. Ozone concentrations are retrieved from IASI radiances using the FORLI algorithm implemented at EUMETSAT. The CrIS instruments on Suomi-NPP and JPSS satellites have been launched in 2011 and 2017, respectively. The TROPESS team at JPL processed ozone data from CrIS radiances for the period 2015-present. We use these datasets to analyze tropospheric O3 trends derived from IASI and CrIS for the common period 2015-present on global, hemispheric, and regional scales.
