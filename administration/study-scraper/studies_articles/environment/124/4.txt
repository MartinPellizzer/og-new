In conclusion, this study provides evidence that telomere shortening may play a key role in ambient ozone exposure-related IR. The findings have important implications for understanding the health effects of air pollution and identifying potential therapeutic targets for IR prevention and treatment. Future studies should investigate the specific mechanisms underlying this relationship and explore ways to mitigate the negative impacts of O3 exposure on human health.
