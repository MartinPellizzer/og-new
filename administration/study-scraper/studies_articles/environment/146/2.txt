The results show that ozone damages photosynthesis, plant structure and function, as well as productivity. A common symptom of ozone injury is small stipple-like lesions on the leaf surface. Recently matured leaves are more susceptible to ozone damage than very young or old leaves. The radiative forcing from increases in tropospheric ozone was estimated to be 0.35Â±0.15 Wm-2.
