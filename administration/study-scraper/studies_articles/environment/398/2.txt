The results showed that CIs formed in the ozonolysis of trans-2-pentene react bimolecularly with aldehydes to form high molecular weight products, whereas no such products were observed in the ozone-assisted oxidation reaction of cyclopentene. This suggests that decomposition may be the primary fate of long-chain CIs in this system. Additionally, threshold ionization energy calculations revealed the detection of ketohydroperoxide intermediates, 2-hydroperoxypentan-3-one and 2-hydroperoxycyclopentanone, in the ozone-assisted oxidation of trans-2-pentene and cyclopentene, respectively.
