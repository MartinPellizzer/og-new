In conclusion, the use of UV/Ozone accelerated aging technique has been demonstrated as an effective method for preparing artificial deteriorated standard dyed woolen samples for textile conservation purposes. The results highlight the potential benefits of this approach in conserving and preserving historical textiles by providing a quick and reliable way to simulate natural aging processes. Further research is needed to explore the applications of this technique in various conservation settings and its potential for scaling up to larger fabric samples.
