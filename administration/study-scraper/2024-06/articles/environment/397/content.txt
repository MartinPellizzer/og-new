Here are five detailed paragraphs based on the study:

**Paragraph 1**
Methane (CH4) is a potent greenhouse gas that contributes to the production of ozone gas, a significant air pollutant. In Europe, surface ozone concentrations exceed safe levels, posing health and environmental risks. Understanding the impact of CH4 emission reductions on surface ozone is crucial for developing effective mitigation strategies. This study investigates the effects of methane and other precursor emission reductions on surface ozone in Europe, using the EMEP MSC-W model to simulate scenarios up to 2050.

**Paragraph 2**
The study employs a three-dimensional Eulerian chemistry-transport model to calculate peak season maximum daily 8-hour average (MDA8) O3 concentrations. The analysis includes three scenarios: Current Legislation (CLE), Maximum Feasible Technical (MFR), and LOW, which combines MFR reductions with an additional dietary shift that meets the Paris Agreement objectives on greenhouse gas emissions. Background CH4 concentrations are calculated using a probabilistic Earth System model emulator. Other precursor emissions are also included in the simulation to assess their impact on surface ozone.

**Paragraph 3**
The results show that roughly one-third of the total peak season MDA8 reduction between the CLE and MFR scenarios is attributable to CH4 reductions, primarily due to CH4 emission reductions outside of the EMEP region. The impact of other precursor emission reductions is split nearly evenly between inside and outside the EMEP region. The analysis also highlights the importance of CH4 mitigation, as reducing solely CH4 achieves nearly two-thirds of the total global warming reduction in the LOW scenario compared to the CLE case.

**Paragraph 4**
The study's findings suggest that CH4 emission reductions play a significant role in mitigating surface ozone concentrations in Europe. The analysis also underscores the need to consider multiple indicators when evaluating the impacts of precursor emission reductions on air quality and human health. While peak season MDA8 O3 concentrations show consistent results, other indicators may exhibit different responses to CH4 and other precursor emission reductions.

**Paragraph 5**
In conclusion, this study demonstrates the critical role of methane emission reductions in mitigating surface ozone concentrations in Europe. The findings highlight the importance of considering multiple indicators when evaluating air quality improvements and their impact on human health. By combining MFR reductions with an additional dietary shift, it is possible to achieve significant global warming reduction benefits beyond those achieved through solely air quality improvement measures.
