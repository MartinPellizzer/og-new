Abstract
One effective option to minimize N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) in finished drinking water is to identify and control its precursors. However, previous works to identify significant precursors use formation potential (FP) tests using high doses to assure the maximum NDMA formation rather than the NDMA formation in finished waters. In this study, we applied characteristic low treatment doses of ozone (O3)-to-dissolved organic carbon (DOC) of target compounds of 0.8 mg/mg and NH2Cl of 2.5 ± 0.2 mg Cl2/L to evaluate the NDMAFP yields of organic compounds bearing N,N-dimethylamine (DMA) and N,N-dimethylhydrazine (DMH) during preozonation and post-chloramination. The results in pH-buffered Milli-Q water showed a significant decrease from ≤ 52% to non-detectable levels in the O3-NDMAFP yields of O3-reactive precursors (i.e., DMH-like compounds) after preozonation and post-chloramination. Similarly, a significant decrease from 0.5 to 12% to nonquantifiable levels was observed for the NH2Cl-NDMAFP yields of NH2Cl-reactive precursors; however, the NH2Cl-NDMAFP yields of N,N-dimethylbenzylamine (DMBzA)-like compounds only decreased from ~ 110 to ≤ 43%, suggesting that these compounds could contribute to NH2Cl-NDMAFPs even after preozonation. The effect of the matrix in sewage-effluent and lake water samples varied and was specific for precursors; for example, the O3-NDMAFP yield of 1,1,1′,1′-tetramethyl-4,4′-(methylene-di-p-phenylene) disemicarbazide (TMDS), an important O3-reactive NDMA precursor, did not significantly decrease when tested in sewage-effluent samples. Based on the previous occurrence concentration of TMDS in sewage samples, we estimated an NDMAFP of ~ 315 ng/L. This estimate exceeds the guidance concentrations of NDMA (3–100 ng/L), highlighting the importance of TMDS and its related compounds for NDMA formation.
