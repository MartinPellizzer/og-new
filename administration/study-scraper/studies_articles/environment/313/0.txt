Germicidal ultraviolet lamps outputting 222 nm light (GUV222) have been found to be effective in inactivating pathogens while remaining safe for human exposure. However, recent studies have also identified these lamps as a source of secondary pollutants such as ozone and secondary organic aerosol (SOA). Understanding the formation and composition of SOA is crucial for balancing the benefits of pathogen inactivation against the potential health effects of these pollutants. This study examines the impact of GUV222 light on SOA formation and composition by comparing limonene oxidation under GUV222 and O3-only control conditions in a laboratory chamber.
