The study used a combination of two analytical methods: synchrotron-based mass-selected photoelectron spectroscopy and orbitrap chemical ionization mass spectrometry. The authors selected 1-hexene as the test molecule, which was exposed to ozone at temperatures ranging from 300-800 K. The reaction products were analyzed using the two methods, allowing for the detection of highly oxygenated organic molecules.
