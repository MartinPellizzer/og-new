The study's findings revealed that a one standard deviation increase in PM2.5 was associated with a significant decline of 0.15σ in labor productivity. Similarly, a one standard deviation increase in carbon monoxide and ozone was linked to declines of 0.14σ and 0.09σ respectively. The results suggest that the negative impact of air pollution on productivity is not limited to PM2.5 alone, but rather it is a complex phenomenon involving multiple pollutants. Moreover, the study found that carbon monoxide was responsible for more than half of the total productivity lost due to air pollution.
