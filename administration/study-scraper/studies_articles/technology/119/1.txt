To develop this innovative technology, various reactor configurations and operational conditions were studied under different types of light sources. Nanoparticles with unique properties, such as magnetic and photocatalytic capabilities, were synthesized and characterized for their potential in degrading micropollutants. The reactors employed varied catalysts, including TiO2 and ZnO, which were tested in combination with the nanoparticles to enhance reaction efficiency.
