Here is a summary of the study in one detailed paragraph, focusing on the information related to ozone:

The article "Advances in PPG Sensors Data Acquisition with Light-to-Digital Converters: A Review" reviews recent developments in photoplethysmography (PPG) monitoring, specifically highlighting advancements in light-to-digital converters (LDCs). The study mentions that PPG sensors have gained popularity due to their non-invasive nature and applications in various fields, including cardiovascular monitoring, brain mapping, glucose sensing, skin cancer detection, ozone pollutant sensing, and commercial fitness tracking. However, the authors note challenges such as LED power consumption, low perfusion index, ambient light interference, and motion artefacts affecting PPG sensor performance. They discuss sampling methods to mitigate these issues, including uniform aggressive, compressive, and event-driven methods, as well as circuit solutions to improve signal quality and reduce power consumption.
