The experiments were conducted at neutral pH with varying concentrations of O3 and PMS. The degradation rates were monitored using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and the concentrations of reactive species were analyzed through electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy. The effects of oxidants, UV328 concentration, and reaction time on the degradation performance were investigated.
