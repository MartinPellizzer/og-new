In this study, researchers K. Lavanya and J. Vijayasekhar investigated the combinational vibrational frequencies of ozone using the Hamiltonian operator based on the unitary Lie algebra. The goal was to extend the computation of vibrational frequencies up to the sixth overtone and compare it with experimental findings and fundamental vibrational spectra. This study aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of the properties of ozone, a molecule that is crucial in atmospheric chemistry and environmental science.
