In conclusion, this study provides evidence for the efficacy and safety of anti-aging integrative therapy as a potential intervention for reversing cellular aging and improving quality of life. The significant increases in telomere length and reductions in biological age observed in this study suggest that further research is warranted to fully understand the mechanisms underlying these effects and to explore its applications in clinical settings.
