Here is a summarized paragraph focused on the information related to ozone:

The study aimed to develop and optimize an innovative technology for removing micropollutants from wastewater using advanced oxidation systems that employ nanoparticles. Although traditional Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs) like ozone and UV radiation have been successful, they require high energy consumption, hindering economic viability. The researchers explored the use of photocatalytic processes integrating magnetic nanocomposites, which could potentially reduce energy costs. However, ozone production and light source requirements still pose a challenge to ensure the technology's efficiency.
