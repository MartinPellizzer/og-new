The methods used in this study involved collecting VOC concentrations at the four monitoring sites over a period of several months. The measurements were conducted using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and were analyzed to identify the various NMVOC species present. The data were then used to calculate ozone formation potential (OFP) values, which are an indicator of the reactivity of VOCs with ozone. Additionally, a potential source contribution function (PSCF) was employed to identify the likely sources of the VOC emissions.
