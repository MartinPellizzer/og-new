The scientific group of the Sukhumi State University, TSU and the Scientific and Technical Innovation Center "Savelimisoni" have developed a combined solar-energy device with ozone and ultraviolet radiation with special technical and economic characteristics. Ozone is widely used in various areas of the national economy, in medicine, in the food industry. In the article by the research team is described ozogenerators of various modifications and capacities, by what it’s possible the desinfection some of the specific objects, which was developed for use in the production of dairy products and in sugar production technologies. The ozonegenerator "Samani-4", which can apply the high bactericidal effects of ozone, was used at various stages of sugar production. The ozone developed from the generator "Samani-1" was used in the dairy industry. The introduction of ozone into the technological cycle of food production increases the efficiency of the process at different stages, improves the quality of the product, reduces the cost of chlorine and other filter materials.

Introduction. Оzonization as an effective of dry low-temperature disinfection and sterilization of equipment, any premises, enclosed volumes, products and air method has found wide application. Application of ozonization allows to replace steam and chemical treatment of vessels, tanks, equipment for energy saving purposes. Ozone promotes the sterile storage of dry-salted fur-fur raw materials and finished products. Primary for the preservation of plant raw materials in the food industry.
By supplying different kinds of bacteria, ozone allows to increase the shelf life of milk, canned juices and mineral water. Disinfection treatment of water and packaging is one of the most important stages in the production of beverages. The use of ozone in the dairy industry can delay the process of sour milk.
In spite of the few research reports and publications published in the beginning of the 20th century, ozone was already successfully used in several large installations in Europe. Van Lauer and Trokiet described (as far as 1928) the methods of using ozone in breweries. I. R. Tenney in 1972 again paied attention at the possibilities of using ozone in the food industry. The main reason for the small spread of these methods was the technical short comings of the ozonegenerators.
Research results. According to the famous institutions of epidemiology and microbiology E. coli, st. albus, Ps. Fluorescent, in the process of cultivation of culture and various surface microphones, ozone concentration 106-124 mg/m2 in 30 minutes will receive high levels of

disinfection. The widespread use of ozone in our country was hindered because we didn't have the reliable generator for receving required concentration ozone.
The scientific team of Sokhumi State universiti,TSU and the company '' Savelemisioni'' have developed the ozozgenerator with varius modifivation and options ,throught which it is possible to dezinpect the objects much cheaper.
Electricity consumption is just 5 watts / hours compared to its world analogs in comparison to cheap analogues 3,5 times. The hybrid of the new ozogenerator is tested and is underway. Because of devices attractive technical - economic characteristics using different areas it has many consumers and has been successfully used in our country, the enterprise: in mineral water Likani enterprise, in Natakhtari meat ben, in Tbilisi 4 bakery, Orkhevi food processing factory and etc.. Total 18 foodstuffs in Georgia
With ozogenerator "Samani-4" developed by the scientific group, was adopted the ozone with high bactericied effect for using at a different stages of sugar production. Effect of ozone effectiveness induces an inactivation of all types microorganisms. Ozonation causes:
a. Separates carbon dioxide, methane and hydrogen, resulting what reduces the foaming.
b. The juice is saturated with high-molecular polysaccharides (dextrans, pectines), which are applied for filtration and purification of juice.
c. The number of sapons increases.
The ozone produced by the "Samani-4" generator, with a high bactericidal effect, was used at different stages of sugar production and is much more effective than chlorine. Effect of ozone efficiency induces inactivation of all types of microorganisms. With the Ozonation causes:
a. releases carbon dioxide, methane and hydrogen,which leads to a reduction of the foam content.
b. The juice saturated with high-molecular polysaccharides (dextrans, pectins), which filters and purifies the juice.
c. Increases the number of vapors.
Table 1. Diffusion quality of juice
Quality indicators Before Processing with ozone Afterozone Processing Privileges

2. Filtering ability ml/min 100 ml 28-30 min 100 ml 8-10 min Grows 2-4 times
3. Dry substances (%) 14,4-16,9 14,1-16,2 Decreases by 0,3-0,7%
4. Good quality (%) on sugar dry substances 74,5-80,5 82,0-89,4 Increase of Good quality by 7,5-8,9 %
5. pH 7,1-7,8 5,5-6,2
6. Sugar % 11,6-12,6 12,6-13,3 Increases by 0,7-1%
7. Using foam suppression Using is not There is no need Demand for foam
8. Formaline separation Using is not There is no need Demand for Formaline
9. Gas emissions Is is not Improves storage microflora
10. Non existence of Sapons Is is not
In Sante Milk factory was conducted the test of the ozogenerator 1 combined with superficial sterilization of the technological equipment and air purification. From the 9 heat of the unwanted plant in 8 was found an intestinal scratching bacteria. During 20 minutes after the injection, the intestinal bacteria were not observed.

Conclusions. Consumed electricity consumption decreases 3.5 - 4 times in sugar production by the use ozogenerator "samanin - 4"
The economical effectiveness of the proposed method is:
1. Increase the yield of sugar at diffusion stage 1 tons of products produced 7.5 kg;
2. Increase the yield of sugar as a result of its concentration in diffuse juice. At the stage o diffusion, 1 tons of products produced 5.5 kg;
3. Increase the yield of sugar at the expense of juice cleaning effect 1 ton of product produces 0,25 kg;
4. Saving as a result of excluding foam suppression and formalin use;
5. Saving as a result of decrease in energy expenditure;
6. Saving as a result of filter effectivness.
The findings of the research show that ozogenerator "Saman-1" can be successfully used in the processing of different types of milk production techniques.
This constructor is a new generation hybrid option. The sunny countries of the south as United Arab Emirates, Qatar are especially interested in it. We have business contacts with them and are negotiating for joint projects.
