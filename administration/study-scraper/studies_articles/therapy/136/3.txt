The study's results are consistent with previous research on the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of Aloe vera and ozone. The combination of these properties may have enhanced the therapeutic potential of ozonated Aloe vera oil in promoting radiation dermatitis wound healing. Further studies are needed to elucidate the exact mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of ozonated Aloe vera oil and to determine its optimal concentration for clinical use.
