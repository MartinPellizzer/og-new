In conclusion, this study demonstrates the significance of incorporating toxicity testing in wastewater treatment evaluations. The results suggest that electrocoagulation and ozonation alone may not be sufficient to completely eliminate toxic compounds from tannery effluents. Further research is needed to develop more effective treatment processes that can simultaneously remove pollutants and reduce toxicity. This comprehensive approach is essential for preserving the environmental quality of receiving water bodies and ensuring sustainable wastewater management practices.
