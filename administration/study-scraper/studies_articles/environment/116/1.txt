To achieve this goal, the research team employed a high-yield and high-quality japonica rice variety, Nanjing 9108, in a field experiment. The O3-Temperature-Free Air Enrichment (O3-T-FACE) facility was used to cultivate the rice under different environmental conditions. Two levels of O3 exposure were tested: ambient O3 concentration (A-O3) and elevated O3 concentration (E-O3), which was 1.5 times ambient O3 concentration. Additionally, two temperature treatments were applied: ambient temperature (CK) and all-time warming treatment (WT), which increased the temperature by 2Â°C. The experiment consisted of four treatment combinations: A-O3 + CK, E-O3 + CK, A-O3 + WT, and E-O3 + WT.
