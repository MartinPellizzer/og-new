Here is a summary of the study in 1 detailed paragraph, focusing on information related to ozone:

The toxicity assessment of tannery wastewater treated via electrocoagulation and ozonation using Lactuca sativa L. lettuce seeds revealed that despite 92% removal efficiency for total suspended solid (TSS) and 10% removal efficiency for chemical oxygen demand (COD) in the electrocoagulation reactor, acute toxicity was still present in all three samples. The addition of ozonation further reduced COD by 18%, but the average inhibition concentration (EC50) values indicated persistent acute toxicity. This suggests that incomplete removal of pollutants and formation of recalcitrant compounds during treatment processes contributed to the maintained toxicity, emphasizing the importance of considering toxicological parameters when assessing treatments to preserve environmental quality.
