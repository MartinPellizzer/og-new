The IASI dataset is a valuable resource for researchers seeking to understand atmospheric trends and exceptional events. The study highlights the importance of continued monitoring of ozone trends and the potential impacts of sudden stratospheric warmings and volcanic eruptions on atmospheric chemistry. As climate change continues to shape our understanding of the Earth's atmosphere, this dataset will remain essential for advancing our knowledge of the complex interactions between atmospheric phenomena and ozone chemistry.
