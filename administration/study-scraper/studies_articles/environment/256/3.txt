The findings of this study highlight the importance of considering Earth-like land-ocean distributions with orography when modeling the atmospheric dynamics and chemistry of tidally locked terrestrial exoplanets. Simply relying on flat land-mass models can lead to incomplete and inaccurate representations of these complex systems. Future studies should therefore pay close attention to both the day-side land-fraction and the orography of the land, as these factors have a significant impact on the atmospheric transport and chemistry of TRAPPIST-1e.
