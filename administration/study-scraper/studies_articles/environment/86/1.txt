The study employed a combination of approaches to examine the relationship between air pollutants and various factors. The study used EPA daily fine particulate matter (PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and ozone (O3) pollutant concentrations from seven metropolitan regions across the US for 2018-2022. Spearman Rank-Order correlation tests were conducted utilizing NOAA's daily weather data, including precipitation, wind speed, and average temperature. Additionally, vehicle miles traveled (VMT) data acquired from Streetlight Data LLC was used to examine the impact of anthropogenic sources on pollutant concentrations.
