The results of our analysis showed that there is a significant correlation between geomagnetic index Ap and total ozone content. We also found that the incidence of COVID-19 worldwide was negatively correlated with geomagnetic index Ap during the first wave of the pandemic. However, during the second wave, the relationship between COVID-19 incidence rates and geomagnetic index Ap became positive. The analysis of sudden stratospheric warmings revealed that they occur more frequently during periods of high solar activity.
