In conclusion, this study highlights the importance of considering the interactive effects of elevated O3 and warming on the stem lodging resistance of rice under fully open-field conditions. The results suggest that elevated O3 concentration significantly reduces the lodging resistance of rice, while warming can partially mitigate these effects. These findings have significant implications for crop breeding and management strategies in a changing climate. Further research is needed to fully understand the complex interactions between environmental factors and plant traits to develop more resilient crops.
