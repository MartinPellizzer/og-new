Here is a summary of the study in 1 detailed paragraph, focusing on ozone-related information and data:

The catalytic ozonation process was used to treat wastewater from Aria Pharmaceuticals' Fluoxetine production unit, with Î³-alumina catalysts synthesized using co-precipitation method. The operating parameters affecting COD removal were investigated, including inlet ozone concentration, amount of catalyst, and reaction time. Results showed that these parameters significantly affected COD removal, with reaction time having the highest impact (35.58%), followed by amount of catalyst (34.64%) and initial ozone concentration (10.87%). Optimal conditions for maximum COD removal (92.13%) were obtained at a reaction time of 30 minutes, 1 g/L catalyst dosage, and 30 mg/L ozone concentration. The central composite design method was used to model and optimize the process, with good agreement between experimental and predicted values.
