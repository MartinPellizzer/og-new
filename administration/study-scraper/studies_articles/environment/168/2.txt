The reprocessed dataset reveals significant changes in global ozone distributions over time. Notably, sudden stratospheric warmings have been found to impact total ozone distributions in both the Southern and Northern Hemispheres. The study also examines the influence of the January 2022 Hunga Tonga volcano eruption on ozone vertical distribution in the Southern Hemisphere.
