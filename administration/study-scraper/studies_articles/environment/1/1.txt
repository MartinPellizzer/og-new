The study uses hourly ozone (O3) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) data sourced from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Air Quality System (US EPA) for a 7-year period between January 2015 to December 2021. Six Arizona sites were selected, including urban and rural areas. The analysis examines diurnal patterns of O3 on weekdays and weekends, as well as seasonal variations across five distinct seasons: fall, winter, spring, dry summer, and monsoon summer.
