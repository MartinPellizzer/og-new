Here are five detailed paragraphs using the information and data from the study:

**Paragraph 1**
The Comprehensive Vertical Ozone Observation Experiment in China aims to evaluate the detection performance of ozone lidars. The experiment was conducted at the Xilinhot National Climate Observatory in Inner Mongolia from August to December 2023. The importance of vertical distribution characteristics of ozone is highlighted, as it plays a significant role in atmospheric chemistry and pollution processes.

**Paragraph 2**
The experiment site was chosen for its flat terrain and minimal obstructions within a 2000 m radius. Four different brands and models of ozone lidars participated in the experiment, with technical parameters presented in Table 1. Additionally, ozone radiosondes were used to collect data on atmospheric pressure, temperature, humidity, partial pressure of ozone, and positional information from near the ground to the burst height of balloon. The Xilinhot Municipal Environmental Protection Monitoring Station (EPS) and the Xilinhot Municipal Government Monitoring Station (MGS) also provided surface ozone concentrations using a near-surface ozone analyzer.

**Paragraph 3**
The comparative studies between four models of ozone lidar, ozone radiosondes, near-surface ozone analyzers, and ozone observations on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platform were conducted. The results show that the relative deviations of four ozone lidars are less than 20% compared with ozone radiosonde measurements at a height between 150 and 400 m. Ozone lidars have better behavior between 400 m and 2000 m than the lower altitude, with the deviation within 10% and the correlation coefficient around 0.8.

**Paragraph 4**
The influence of precipitation events on ozone lidar measurement was investigated, revealing that thick cloud layers, low cloud base, and an intensive precipitation event with large raindrop particles can result in high anomalies and reduce the inversion accuracy of the ozone lidar. The comprehensive performance assessment of four ozone lidars was conducted quantitatively, which could help to improve inversion algorithms and system design.

**Paragraph 5**
In conclusion, this study demonstrates the feasibility and reliability of ozone lidar measurements for vertical distribution characteristics of ozone in China. The experiment results highlight the importance of considering precipitation events when using ozone lidars. Future improvements in inversion algorithms and system design are necessary to further enhance the accuracy and precision of ozone lidar measurements. The findings of this study provide valuable insights into the development of technical standards and norms for ozone lidar detection performance assessment.
