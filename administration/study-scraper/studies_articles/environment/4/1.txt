The methods used in this study included the synthesis of Cu2S/Ni3S2@NF catalyst and its characterization by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). The catalytic ozonation reaction was carried out using a batch reactor, where PNP solution was treated with ozone in the presence of the Cu2S/Ni3S2@NF catalyst. The effects of initial pH, inorganic anions, ozone dose, and catalyst dosage on the degradation of PNP were investigated.
