Abstract
Zinc oxide (ZnO) is a widely explored semiconductor metal oxide. This material has interesting properties for several research areas, including energy storage and harvesting, sensing and electronic applications. Its versatility has led to the development of various approaches for synthesizing nanostructures with different morphologies according to the application. In this chapter, a literature review on vapor phase and solution phase synthesis approaches for synthesizing one-dimensional (1D) ZnO nanostructures on different substrates will be provided to establish a comparison between different processes’ parameters. Since hydrothermal synthesis is the most widely used approach for growing ZnO on different substrates due to its simplicity and cost-effectiveness, the principles of this technique will be detailed. As an experimental demonstration of such technique, novel results obtained at CENIMAT on microwave-assisted hydrothermal synthesis of ZnO nanorods, exploring the influence of seed layer thickness, ultraviolet/ozone (UVO) treatment to this layer, and synthesis time and temperature on the nanostructures’ morphology, will be presented. The nanostructures’ length, diameter and density were measured to establish a correlation between synthesis conditions and nanostructures’ features. A seed layer thickness of 100 nm, a 5 min UVO treatment, and a synthesis time and temperature of 60 min and 100°C led to the formation of ZnO nanorods with increased length and aspect ratio.

1. Introduction
Zinc oxide (ZnO) is an inorganic II-VI n-type semiconductor with a wide and direct band gap (around 3.37 eV) and large exciton binding energy (approximately 60 meV) [1, 2]. Additionally, this metal oxide presents high electron mobility (205 to 300 cm2 V-1 s-1) and tunable conductivity [3, 4, 5, 6].
Zinc oxide nanostructures present good physicochemical and electrochemical properties [1], chemical and thermal stability [2, 7, 8], and high mechanical strength [8]. Besides, this metal oxide also presents biocompatibility and non-toxicity [8, 9].
Zinc oxide can crystallize into one of the three structures depicted in Figure 1: rock salt (cubic), zinc-blend (cubic), or wurtzite (hexagonal) [1, 11]. The rock salt can only be produced at high temperatures, whereas the zinc-blend is stabilized by cubic structures [11]. As such, crystallization in the wurtzite structure is the most thermodynamically favorable [4]. Oxygen atoms tetrahedrally coordinated to four zinc cations (and vice versa) compose the hexagonal wurtzite crystal structure that comprises alternating planes of zinc and oxygen atoms stacked along the c-axis [2, 4]. The net positively charged zinc-terminated planes and the negatively charged oxygen-terminated planes have high energy and act as basal facets of the hexagonal structure, where a zinc-terminated plane is at the top while an oxygen-terminated plane is at the bottom [12]. In contrast, the prismatic lateral faces of the metal oxide crystal are non-polar and present lower energy [2, 4].

A crystal’s preferential growth is determined by the energy of each surface and the amount of active sites [1]. In ZnO, the polar planes have higher energy than the unit cell’s lateral surfaces because polar surfaces are more susceptible to electrostatic interactions [1, 13]. As such, the growth along the direction parallel to the c-axis is favorable since it decreases the free surface energy [1, 2], which is also favored by the increase of the non-polar surfaces’ area during growth [1]. It is worth mentioning that the growth along the c-axis is often promoted by moderate temperatures (at least 80°C), as the growth medium reaches an energy level sufficiently high to allow the attachment of molecules to the crystal’s surfaces [14].
Interestingly, ZnO presents spontaneous polarization due to the noncentrosymmetric nature of its wurtzite structure and the presence of zinc and oxygen basal planes [4, 12]. As there is no center of inversion along the c-axis in a ZnO hexagonal crystal, which leads to asymmetry, the metal oxide nanostructures present piezoelectric properties [1, 4, 9]. Besides the piezoelectricity, ZnO’s properties have led to its use in several applications, including photocatalytic degradation of organic contaminants present in water [14, 15], surface acoustic wave devices [16], solar cells [3, 17], photodetectors [5, 7, 8, 12], scintillator applications [2], photoelectrochemically related applications [18, 19, 20], gas sensors [21], field-emission devices [22], energy storage [23], or radiation absorption [24]. The properties of the ZnO nanostructures, such as the aspect ratio, crystallinity, growth orientation, vertical alignment, density, and lateral ordering, will influence their performance [12, 25]. As such, precise tuning of the nanostructures’ properties by determining their synthesis method and controlling their synthesis kinetics is decisive in the final performance [12].

2. Approaches for the synthesis of vertically aligned ZnO nanostructures
The variety of fabrication techniques to synthesize ZnO has led to a wide assortment of nanostructures [2]. ZnO nanostructures can be synthesized in different morphologies, such as nanotubes, nanowires, nanorods (NRs), nanocombs, nanoneedles, nanorings, microspheres, nanobelts, nanosheets, tetrapods, and nanohelices, depending on the synthesis parameters [1, 17, 18].
Among the several ZnO nanostructures, one-dimensional (1D) ZnO materials have been the focus of many research groups due to their physical, mechanical, and electronic properties [12, 25] and improved optical performance compared to bulk form [2]. Namely, when compared with films, 1D nanostructures present lower recombination rates and larger surface-to-volume ratio, desirable features in several areas such as electronics and sensing [12, 20, 26]. Moreover, ZnO nanowires, nanorods, and nanotubes’ features also promote electron conduction in the uniaxial direction [5, 26].
Several approaches have been reported to synthesize aligned ZnO nanostructures, including synthesis from both solution and vapor phases [4] techniques, such as pulsed laser deposition (PLD), chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) [25, 27]. On the other hand, these materials have also been synthesized using chemical bath deposition (CBD) and electrodeposition [25, 27].
2.1 Vapor phase synthesis of ZnO nanostructures
VLS, PLD, CVD, and microwave-plasma assisted thermal evaporation (MPATE) have been employed to grow ZnO nanostructures under vacuum and at high temperatures, as summarized in Table 1. These techniques offer versatility in tailoring the nanostructure’s properties, making them valuable for applications in electronics, sensors, and optoelectronics [1].

2.1.1 Vapor-liquid-solid method
Vapor-liquid-solid is a widely utilized method where a metal catalyst acts as a seed for the nanostructures’ growth, guiding the vapor phase precursor to solidify into the desired morphology on the catalyst surface [38].
One-dimensional nanorods can be fabricated through a process known as the vapor phase method. This method produces vapor through chemical and gaseous reactions and evaporation. The targeted vapor undergoes rapid heating before slowly cooling on the substrate, forming 1D nanomaterials. Although the theory makes the procedure look straightforward, it must be done at extremely high temperatures of around 1000°C to evaporate the source materials, such as zinc or ZnO powder. It is essential to analyze this process’s additional reactions and breakdown [39]. You et al. reported the fabrication of vertically aligned ZnO nanowire arrays by the vapor phase transport approach to be employed as self-driven solar-blind photodetectors with superior sensitivity. This study used a mixture of ZnO and carbon powders as precursors that were heated at 1050°C for 20 min. The produced arrays were then homogeneously coated with 20 nm thick monoclinic gallium oxide (Ga2O3) through sputtering methods to form vertically aligned ZnO/Ga2O3 core/shell nanowire arrays [28]. Also in 2019, You et al. reported a similar process; however, before the powder evaporation, a thin 50 nm ZnO seed layer was deposited by radio frequency (RF) sputtering. Here, the evaporation of ZnO and graphite powders at 1050°C for 30 min produced nanowires of around 300 nm in diameter. Finally, a zinc tellurium (ZnTe) layer was grown as a shell on the ZnO nanorod array surface by RF sputtering, creating a self-powered photodetector that relied on the coupling between the photovoltaic and pyroelectric effects [6].
2.1.2 Pulsed laser deposition
Pulsed laser deposition of ZnO nanowires uses a femtosecond pulsed laser to ablate a ZnO target, creating a plume of material that subsequently condenses on a substrate to form nanowire structures [30]. It is worth noting that this process requires high temperatures (between 500 and 600°C) [30]. The femtosecond laser pulses enable precise control over the deposition process, offering advantages, such as high spatial resolution and minimal damage to the substrate. Zhang et al. reported the use of this approach to grow ZnO nanowires with good crystallinity and reasonably uniform diameters, which can be attributed to the homogeneity of femtosecond laser-produced precursor vapor in which micron-sized particulates are minimal [40].
2.1.3 Chemical vapor deposition
Chemical vapor deposition involves the controlled deposition of ZnO on a substrate through chemical reactions in the vapor phase [41]. It is a vapor route process frequently used to manufacture ZnO nanorods on horizontal tube furnace systems, where oxygen gas is required. Zinc [42] and ZnO powder [43] are typical precursors used in forming ZnO nanorods by CVD, where temperatures between 450 and 900°C or up to 1200°C (respectively) are required to perform the synthesis. Zinc vapor is deposited on the surface of the heated substrate and reacts with oxygen to form ZnO nanorods. Synthesis parameters, such as substrate type, vacuum pressure, type of carrier gas, and synthesis temperature, are essential factors affecting ZnO nanorods’ structural and piezoelectric properties [44]. Schaper et al. reported in 2021 the fabrication of a novel and advanced approach to directly grow ZnO nanowires on single-walled carbon nanotubes and graphene surfaces through successfully forming 1D-1D and 1D-2D (two-dimensional) heterostructure interfaces. In this study, a mixture of ZnO and graphite precursors was placed in a small quartz boat that was heated up to 930°C, while the samples were heated to 270°C, using only Argon [32]. Kolhelp et al. reported a similar method but with two modifications. An initial 70 nm ZnO seed layer was deposited by atomic layer deposition (ALD), and the nanostructures’ growth was performed employing a controlled oxygen flow. The procedure led to the formation of nanowires with lengths up to 12 µm [31]. Furthermore, Swathi et al. reported the fabrication of branched ZnO nanorods by adding a second step after the initial ZnO growth by CVD, in which zinc seeds were coated
