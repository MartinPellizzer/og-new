Here is a summary of the study in one detailed paragraph, focusing on ozone-related information and data:

The environmental impact of inhalers goes beyond carbon footprint, including ozone depletion, fossil and metal depletion, and ocean acidification. A study found that MDIs with HFC-134a propellant have a lower or similar impact compared to DPIs in 11 of the 14 environmental areas, although this study was funded by a propellant manufacturer. The Montreal Protocol estimates that the daily use of an aerosol inhaler is equivalent to driving ∼1 km, while a weekly burger is equivalent to driving ∼3 km daily. The CASCADES poster presents an extreme case, and switching inhalers is not a high-yield intervention with uncertain actual carbon impact.
