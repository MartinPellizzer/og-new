The meta-analysis included 11 studies comprising 960 patients with DFU. The results demonstrated a significant positive effect of ozone therapy on reducing foot ulcer size (Standardized Mean Difference: -25.84, 95% CI: -51.65 to -0.04, p = 0.05), shortening mean healing time (Standardized Mean Difference: -38.59, 95% CI: -51.81 to -25.37, p < 0.001), decreasing hospital length of stay (Standardized Mean Difference: -8.75, 95% CI: -14.81 to -2.69, p < 0.001), and reducing amputation rates (Relative Risk: 0.46, 95% CI: 0.30-0.71, p < 0.001).
