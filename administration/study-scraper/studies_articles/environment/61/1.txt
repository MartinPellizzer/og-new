In this study, three MOF-carbonized materials (Me-MOF-C, Me: Fe, Cu, and Zn) were synthesized as ozone catalysts for water purification. The synthesis process involved a combination of solvothermal treatment and carbonization. The resulting materials were characterized using various techniques, including scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.
