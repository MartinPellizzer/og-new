Here is a summary of the study in one detailed paragraph, focusing on the information and data related to ozone:

Aqueous solutions of ozone have been shown to be a promising alternative to chlorine-containing disinfectants, with benefits including high efficiency in inactivating microorganisms, reduced corrosion of materials, and comparable economic indicators. The study analyzed technical aspects of using ozone and hypochlorites for surface disinfection, including ozone generation, dissolution in water, parameter control, ozone destruction, microbial inactivation efficiency, and safety. Results indicate that the half-life of 20 minutes ensures high efficiency of inactivation of microorganisms, with no need for subsequent destruction of residual ozone. Comparison with hypochlorites shows significant superiority of ozone in inactivating microorganisms on various surfaces, allowing for reduced disinfection time and corrosion reduction. The study highlights the technical and environmental feasibility of using ozone for surface disinfection, providing important data for developing appropriate technologies.
