The study highlights the benefits of ozone/BAC pretreatment, including improved water quality, reduced operating pressures and chemical use, and increased public health protection. The results also show that the experimental DPR treatment train operated at lower operation and maintenance (O&M) costs compared to traditional treatment trains. The study's findings support the economic viability of ozone/BAC-based DPR treatment trains.
