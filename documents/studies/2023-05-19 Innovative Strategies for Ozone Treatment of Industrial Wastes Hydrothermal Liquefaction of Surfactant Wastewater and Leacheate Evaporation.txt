---------------------------------------------------

problem:
	pretreatment wastewater

experiment:
	landfill leachate treated by a reverse osmosis
	defoamig?
	biocide?
	pH acidifier? to avoid ammonia
	hydrothermal liquefaction (for crude-oil)

result:
	slight defoaming
	no difference id HHV of the crude-oils
	noticivle difference in the solid residue (weight reduction 20%)
		
objective:
	interesting for the problems that solids can generate in pipes and valves
