To investigate the effect of Ozone MNBs on "green" and its mechanism in soybean sprout, researchers treated soybean sprouts with 4 mg/L Ozone MNBs and stored them under white LED condition. The physical quality, synthesizing and decomposing of chlorophyll (enzyme activity and substance) were measured in the treated soybean sprouts. The control group was treated with distilled water instead of Ozone MNBs. The researchers used a series of biochemical assays to measure the activities of enzymes involved in chlorophyll synthesis and degradation.
