In conclusion, this meta-analysis provides a comprehensive assessment of the effects of elevated O3 on MDA content, SOD activity, and POD activity in herbaceous plants. The results highlight the importance of considering plant species, O3 concentration, and exposure duration when evaluating the impact of elevated O3 on plant antioxidant systems. The study's findings have implications for understanding plant adaptation to O3 stress under global change and can inform strategies for mitigating the negative effects of elevated O3 on plant productivity and ecosystems.
