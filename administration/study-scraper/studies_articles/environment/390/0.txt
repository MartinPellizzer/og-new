Ozone (O3) is a global environmental problem that affects plant growth and productivity. Elevated O3 concentrations can lead to visible damage, reduced photosynthesis, accelerated aging, inhibited growth, and even plant death. However, its impact has not been comprehensively evaluated due to differences in response between individual plant species, environmental O3 concentration, and duration of O3 stress. This study aims to examine the effects of elevated O3 on malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and peroxidase (POD) activities in herbaceous plants using a meta-analysis approach.
