Abstract
Air pollution, a silent public health crisis, demands smarter solutions. This research explores a novel approach: using machine learning and the Internet of Things (IoT) to predict hyper-local Air Quality Index (AQI). We integrate a Random Forest algorithm with NodeMCU for pinpoint-accurate AQI forecasts. The core lies in a robust machine learning model trained on historical data rich in environmental parameters-air quality indicators like PM2.5 and ozone, coupled with meteorological factors. This empowers the model to predict future AQI levels with exceptional accuracy. Real-time data acquisition is handled by NodeMCU, an IoT platform acting as our environmental guardian. It gathers live data and feeds it to the model, enabling real-time, location-specific AQI predictions. The model's effectiveness is rigorously evaluated, achieving a promising 99% accuracy-a testament to its potential to revolutionize air quality management. By harnessing the power of machine learning and IoT, this research paves the way for a future where proactive air quality management fosters healthier cities and a more sustainable future.
