Here are the five paragraphs summarizing the scientific study:

**Paragraph 1**
The removal of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is a crucial aspect of air pollution control. Currently, there is a growing interest in developing novel catalysts that can simultaneously eliminate NOx and VOCs via the existing deNOx devices. In this study, FeVO4 was selected to replace V2O5 in commercial ammonia-based selective catalytic reduction (NH3-SCR) catalysts due to its low biotoxicity.

**Paragraph 2**
The catalytic behavior of the FeVO4/TiO2 catalyst was evaluated using a combination of experimental and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The catalyst composition was prepared by mixing FeVO4 with TiO2, and the samples were characterized using various techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The DFT calculations were used to simulate the charge transfer between Fe and V within the FeVO4 cluster.

**Paragraph 3**
The experimental results showed that the 11 wt.% FeVO4/TiO2 catalyst exhibited satisfactory NOx reduction and VOC oxidation performance at temperatures ranging from 300-400Â°C. Abundant active oxygen species and vacancies in the catalyst were found to be responsible for its excellent catalytic activity. Furthermore, the coaction between FeVO4 components and TiO2 substrate promoted the formation of oxygen vacancies, which accelerated the catalytic reactions.

**Paragraph 4**
The DFT calculations supported the experimental findings by verifying the charge transfer between Fe and V within the FeVO4 cluster. This modified the surface electronic structure and enriched V5+, strengthening the surface activity. The results highlighted the synergistic removal of NOx and VOCs on the FeVO4/TiO2 catalyst, which was attributed to its unique redox ability and charge transfer properties.

**Paragraph 5**
In conclusion, this study demonstrated the potential of the FeVO4/TiO2 catalyst for simultaneous NOx reduction and VOC oxidation. The synergistic removal of pollutants was found to be driven by the abundant active oxygen species, vacancies, and coaction between FeVO4 components and TiO2 substrate. The DFT calculations provided insights into the charge transfer mechanism, which modified the surface electronic structure and enhanced the catalytic activity. The findings of this study have important implications for developing novel catalysts for air pollution control.
