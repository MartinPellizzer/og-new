The experimental procedure involved passing ozone through a sample tube containing 1,2-dichlorobenzene. The reaction solution was sampled every hour, and the samples were analyzed using FTIR and GC/MS spectrometry. The ozone generator used in this study was capable of producing high-purity ozone gas with a concentration of 99.999%. The experimental setup is shown in Figure 1, which consists of an oxygen gas tank, ozone generator, control valve, sample tube, magnetic stirrer, hot plate, and oil tube.
