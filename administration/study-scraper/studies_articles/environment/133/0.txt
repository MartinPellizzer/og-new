Soil nitrous acid (HONO) emissions have been identified as a significant contributor to atmospheric pollution, affecting air quality and vegetation. Climate change and fertilizer use are major drivers of soil HONO emissions, but long-term global estimates of these emissions are lacking. This study aims to quantify the changes in soil HONO emissions over the past four decades and assess their impacts on ozone (O3) and vegetation exposure.
