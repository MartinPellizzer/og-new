The results showed that the Cu2S/Ni3S2@NF catalyst exhibited high activity and stability in catalytic ozonation of PNP. The removal rate of PNP reached 99.9% within 40 minutes under optimal experimental conditions. ESR analysis revealed that singlet oxygen and superoxide radicals were the primary species responsible for PNP degradation.
