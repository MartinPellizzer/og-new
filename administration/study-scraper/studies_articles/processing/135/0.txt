The discharge of pharmaceutical wastewater into surface and underground water poses significant risks to human health and living organisms, even at low concentrations. Pharmaceutical wastewater treatment is crucial to mitigate these environmental concerns. Aria Pharmaceuticals' Fluoxetine production unit was chosen for this study due to its high concentration of toxic chemicals in the wastewater effluent. This research aimed to develop an effective method for treating Fluoxetine-containing wastewater using catalytic ozonation.
