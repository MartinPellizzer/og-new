Here are the five detailed paragraphs using the information and data from the scientific study:

**Paragraph 1**
The current national primary ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) in the United States aim to protect public health by setting limits for six pollutants, including ozone. However, recent studies have raised concerns about the safety of these standards. A new case-crossover analysis published in this issue of the International Journal of Epidemiology investigates the association between ozone concentrations and daily visits to hospital emergency departments (EDs) by children.

**Paragraph 2**
The study used a case-crossover design, analyzing data from 42 facilities across the United States over a period of four years. Estimated maximum 8-hour ozone concentrations were linked to daily ED visit counts for any cause and specific respiratory causes. The analysis included âˆ¼28 million visits, making it one of the largest studies of its kind.

**Paragraph 3**
The results showed significant associations between ozone concentration and numbers of ED visits for all-causes and selected respiratory causes at levels below the current NAAQS. When restricting the analysis to days with ozone concentrations below the NAAQS, statistically significant associations persisted. These findings suggest that the current US ozone standard may not be sufficient to protect public health.

**Paragraph 4**
The study's findings have important implications for air quality policy and public health. The authors' conclusion that the current ozone standard is inadequate raises questions about the safety of this pollutant. Further research is needed to better understand the effects of ozone on child health and to inform more effective regulations.

**Paragraph 5**
In conclusion, this study provides new evidence that ozone concentrations below the current NAAQS are associated with increased risk of ED visits in children. The findings have important implications for public health and air quality policy. Further research is needed to better understand the effects of ozone on child health and to inform more effective regulations to protect public health.
