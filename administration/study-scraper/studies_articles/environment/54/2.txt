The study found that treatment with ozone gas resulted in significant reductions in surface microbial load across all fruit and vegetable samples tested. Furthermore, the treated produce exhibited improved quality parameters, including enhanced texture and color retention. Notably, the application of ozone gas did not leave behind any harmful residues, as the final product was breathable oxygen.
