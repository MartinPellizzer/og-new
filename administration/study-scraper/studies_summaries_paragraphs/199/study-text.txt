This study analyzed the relationship between nitrogen oxides (NOx) and ground-level ozone (O3) in London using hourly concentration data from 2012-2022. Results showed that NOx concentrations decreased over the decade, leading to a significant increase in O3 levels, particularly during peak solar radiation hours. The study also observed an "ozone weekend effect" where O3 levels were higher on weekends compared to weekdays at urban area stations. Mean O3 concentrations peaked in late spring, potentially linked to heating emissions and stratospheric ozone intrusion. Regression analysis revealed significant decreasing trends in annual mean NOx concentrations across all stations, attributed to emission control strategies implemented in London.
