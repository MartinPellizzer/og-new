The results showed that the outcomes derived from the Hamiltonian operator based on the unitary Lie algebra exhibited a high level of accuracy, closely aligning with the experimental results. The comparison between experimental findings and fundamental vibrational spectra revealed that the model accurately captured the combinational vibrational frequencies of ozone up to the sixth overtone.
