Here is a summary of the study in one paragraph, focusing on information related to ozone:

The study investigates how natural tropical oscillations, specifically the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO), affect ozone content and meridional circulation in the boreal winter stratosphere. Results show that QBO phases influence vertical distributions of ozone in the equatorial stratosphere and strength/weakness of secondary meridional circulation in the tropics. Under El Niño conditions, an enhancement of residual meridional circulation from the tropical to polar stratosphere is stronger at altitudes where ozone is higher in the tropics. Conversely, La Niña conditions lead to modifications and intensification of meridional transport, resulting in lowest ozone content in the polar stratosphere by February. Numerical experiments using the Middle and Upper Atmosphere Model (MUAM) confirm these tendencies in changes in meridional transport for different QBO/ENSO combinations. These findings have implications for understanding the role of tropical oscillations in shaping ozone variability in the extra-tropical stratosphere during winter.
