In conclusion, this study demonstrates the effectiveness of the updates to NOAA's online-coupled air quality model version 7 (AQMv7) within the Unified Forecast System (UFS). The improved model shows significant enhancements in simulating O3 and PM2.5 concentrations over the continental United States. Further refinements are necessary to address remaining challenges, particularly with regards to PM2.5 predictions near fire emission sources. Overall, the study highlights the importance of continued model development for reliable air quality forecasting.
