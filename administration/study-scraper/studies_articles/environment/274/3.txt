The findings of this study highlight the need for further research into the molecular mechanisms underlying plant tolerance to air pollution. Field studies are particularly important for understanding how plants respond to complex mixtures of pollutants in real-world environments. The identification of tolerant plant species and their associated molecular traits could inform the development of sustainable Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) for mitigating urban air pollution.
