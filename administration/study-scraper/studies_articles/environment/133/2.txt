The results show that climate change and fertilizer use have increased global soil HONO emissions by 2.4 Tg N (11.0 to 13.4 Tg N) between 1980 and 2016. The study identified significant increases in soil HONO emissions in specific regions, including India, China, North America, Africa, and South America. Simulations with the updated model showed that these increased emissions led to a global increase of 2.9% (up to 29%) in surface O3 concentrations.
