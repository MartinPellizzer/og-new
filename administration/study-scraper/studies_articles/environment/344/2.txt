The study revealed that Lhasa exhibited a higher OPR (12.8 ± 6.0 ppbv h-1) compared to Beijing (9.4 ± 11.0 ppbv h-1), despite lower NOx levels in the former city. Notably, Lhasa's unique diel variation in VOC-kOH reactivity favored daytime peroxy radical production, pushing the NO turning point higher from morning to noon, resulting in a NOx-limited regime except in the early morning.
