Here are five detailed paragraphs using the information from the study:

**Paragraph 1: Introduction**

The study focused on the emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from coal-fired power plants (CFPPs) in China. VOCs are key precursors for secondary organic aerosols (SOA) and ozone, which have severe impacts on human health and environment. Despite their significant contribution to air pollution, previous studies have primarily concentrated on industrial activities and solvent usage, while investigations on VOCs from CFPPs remain relatively sparse.

**Paragraph 2: Methods**

The study employed field tests in four representative CFPPs to investigate the emission characteristics of 117 VOCs. The sampling sites were equipped with efficient facilities to control nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide, and particulate matter. The VOCs samples were then analyzed using a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC-MS) system. Additionally, a latest local source profile for VOCs from CFPPs was established by integrating field test results with selected literature reviews.

**Paragraph 3: Results**

The study found that oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs) constituted the dominant group of VOCs emitted from CFPPs, accounting for 76.5% of total VOC emissions. Propionaldehyde and formaldehyde were identified as the predominant OVOC species, with concentrations ranging from 32.0% to 24.5%. The results also showed that OVOCs and aromatics were the primary contributors to ozone and SOA formation, respectively.

**Paragraph 4: Discussion**

The study highlights the importance of considering CFPPs as a significant source of VOC emissions in China. The establishment of a latest local source profile for VOCs from CFPPs provides valuable information for accurate emission estimation and air quality modeling. Furthermore, the results emphasize the need to update existing knowledge on VOC emissions from CFPPs due to changes in coal consumption patterns and technological advancements.

**Paragraph 5: Conclusion**

In conclusion, this study investigated the emission characteristics of VOCs from CFPPs in China using field tests and literature reviews. The findings suggest that OVOCs are the dominant group of VOCs emitted from CFPPs, with propionaldehyde and formaldehyde being the predominant species. The results have important implications for air quality modeling and policy-making in China. Further research is needed to improve our understanding of VOC emissions from CFPPs and to develop effective control measures to mitigate their impacts on human health and environment.
