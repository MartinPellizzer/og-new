In conclusion, this thesis demonstrates that controlled environment agriculture using vertical towers can be an effective strategy for commercial duckweed production. The study's findings provide valuable insights into the optimization of abiotic parameters and management protocols for large-scale cultivation of duckweed. Furthermore, the results highlight the potential benefits of using aquaculture technology to reduce total bacterial load in CEA systems. Overall, this research contributes to the development of a sustainable and profitable duckweed industry with far-reaching implications for food security, environmental sustainability, and human health.
