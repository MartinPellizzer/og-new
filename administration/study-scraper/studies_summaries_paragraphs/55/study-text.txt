Here is a summary of the study in 1 detailed paragraph:

Researchers studied the destruction reaction of ozone on surfaces, measuring the time-dependent concentration of ozone using absorption spectroscopy and deriving pseudo-first-order rate constants. The rate constant was found to depend on the surface condition, specifically the concentration of adsorbed oxygen atoms. By changing this surface concentration through reactions with gaseous molecular oxygen, the researchers showed that decreasing the atomic oxygen surface concentration leads to a decrease in the rate constant for ozone destruction. Measured rate constants ranged from 9.0 × 10−5 s−1 to 9.8 × 10−5 s−1, demonstrating the important role of surface conditions in influencing the reaction dynamics.
