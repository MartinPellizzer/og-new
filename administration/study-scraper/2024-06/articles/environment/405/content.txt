Here are the five detailed paragraphs based on the scientific study:

**Paragraph 1**
Xianning City, a city located in the southeastern part of China, is experiencing increasing levels of air pollution, posing significant threats to public health and environmental sustainability. Among various pollutants, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) play a crucial role in the formation of ground-level ozone, which can cause respiratory problems and other adverse effects on human health. This study aims to investigate the composition and sources of VOCs in Xianning City, with a specific focus on ozone-polluted days versus non-polluted days.

**Paragraph 2**
To achieve this goal, the researchers used online monitoring instruments to obtain hourly concentration data of 107 VOCs in the ambient atmosphere of Xianning City from June to August 2021. The monitoring data was collected using a network of atmospheric samplers deployed across the city. The sampling period was chosen to coincide with the peak summer months when air pollution is typically more severe.

**Paragraph 3**
The results show that the daily average concentration of VOCs on ozone-polluted days was significantly higher than that on non-polluted days, at 16.6×10<sup>-9</sup> and 13.9×10<sup>-9</sup>, respectively. The composition of VOCs differed substantially between polluted and non-polluted days, with alkanes, acetone, halogenated hydrocarbons, OVOCs, olefins, acetylenes, and aromatic hydrocarbons accounting for 31.3%, 25.6%, 13.6%, 8.8%, 7.6%, 6.9%, and 6.2% of the total VOC concentration on polluted days, respectively.

**Paragraph 4**
The analysis also reveals that olefins were the most significant contributor to ozone generation potential (OFP), followed by aromatic hydrocarbons, OVOCs, alkanes, and acetylenes. Furthermore, using a principle component model (PMF), the researchers identified motor vehicle emission sources and industrial emission sources as the primary contributors to VOC emissions on polluted days, while motor vehicle emission sources were the dominant source on non-polluted days.

**Paragraph 5**
In conclusion, this study highlights the importance of understanding the composition and sources of VOCs in Xianning City to inform effective air pollution mitigation strategies. The findings suggest that reducing VOC emissions from motor vehicles and industrial sources could be an effective approach to alleviate ozone pollution in the city. Future studies should focus on further elucidating the complex relationships between VOCs, meteorology, and air pollution levels, as well as evaluating the effectiveness of various control measures in reducing VOC emissions and improving air quality in Xianning City.
