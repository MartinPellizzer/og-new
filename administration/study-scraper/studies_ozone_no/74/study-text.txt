Abstract
This systematic review assessed to evaluate the potential correlation between oral health and air pollution. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first systematic review endeavoring to compare air pollution and oral health. A systematic search was performed according to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses) statement and employed the PICO(S) approach (Patient or Population, Intervention, Control or Comparison, Outcome, and Study types). The search was limited to English-language articles, and publications within a 15-year timeframe were included in the electronic search. A comprehensive search was conducted across PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science databases, spanning the years 2008 to 2023, resulting in a total of 4983 scientific articles. A final selection of 11 scientific papers was made based on their study type and the specific air pollutants examined. The selected papers analyzed various air pollutants associated with health-related diseases, including Ozone, Nitrogen Dioxide, Nitrogen Monoxide, Carbon Monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and particulate matter. Three out of eleven of the reviewed studies assert a strong correlation between air pollutants and oral diseases, specifically periodontitis. However, the exact biological mechanisms underlying this correlation do not seem to be fully understood, indicating the need for further comprehensive investigation in this regard. Dentists can contribute to the collective effort by educating their patients about the oral health implications of air pollution, thereby supporting initiatives aimed at promoting environmental and health sustainability.
Keywords: oral health; air pollution; periodontitis; dentistry; systematic review
1. Introduction
Environmental pollution refers to the release or production of harmful substances or contaminants into the natural environment, such as air, water, or soil, which can have detrimental effects on living organisms and ecosystems. Air pollution, specifically, is a complex mixture of particles and gases that can pose significant risks to human health [1]. It arises from various sources, including industrial emissions, transportation activities, and household practices. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that air pollution contributes to approximately 7 million premature deaths worldwide annually [2]. Unfortunately, the European Environment Agency shares this concerning perspective, highlighting the substantial impact of air pollution on the health of the population, particularly in urban areas [3]. Despite notable progress in reducing the emission of primary air pollutants and improving air quality over the past two decades in Europe, thanks in part to the collective efforts toward achieving the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030 [4], many regions still face inadequate air quality. In the previous year, air pollution led to a significant number of premature deaths across the 27 EU Member States (EU-27). Exceeding the World Health Organization’s guideline for the inhalation of fine particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of ≤2.5 μm (PM2.5) resulted in 238,000 premature deaths, and exposure to nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels beyond the recommended limit led to 49,000 premature deaths. Additionally, acute exposure to ozone caused 24,000 premature deaths [2,3]. The gravity of the issue is further emphasized when considering the morbidity effects [2,3].
The WHO has identified PM, NO2, sulfur dioxide (SO2), and ground-level ozone (O3) as the air pollutants with the greatest potential to harm human health [2]. These pollutants have been linked to various health complications, including respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, negative birth outcomes, and neurological disorders [1,5,6]. PM, in particular, is considered highly hazardous in air pollution due to its ability to penetrate deep into the lungs, causing inflammation and tissue damage [1]. Nitrogen oxides (NOx) and SO2, among other pollutants, also have detrimental effects on human health [1,7], contributing to respiratory issues, exacerbating cardiovascular diseases, and even increasing the risk of premature mortality. Moreover, long-term exposure to air pollution has been associated with the development of chronic health conditions such as asthma, lung cancer, and heart disease [1,5,7,8]. These chronic illnesses further highlight the serious implications of sustained exposure to air pollutants. The impact of air pollution on health is particularly significant in vulnerable populations, including children, the elderly, and individuals with pre-existing health conditions [8]. Given the substantial effects of air pollution on health, there is a growing imperative for effective policies and interventions aimed at reducing pollution levels and safeguarding public health. Numerous studies have been conducted over the years to investigate the impact of air pollution on health, focusing on the associated risks [5,7,8,9].
However, there is a noticeable lack of research on the correlation between air pollution and oral health-related pathologies. This represents an intriguing finding that warrants further exploration, considering that inhalation and ingestion are the primary routes of exposure to these air pollutants. It is therefore reasonable to assume a close connection between these pollutants and the oral cavity. However, there is currently a dearth of studies, and notably, no systematic review has been conducted on this specific topic. In this context, dentists can contribute to the collective effort by educating their patients about the oral health implications of air pollution, thereby supporting initiatives aimed at promoting environmental and health sustainability. Consequently, the aim of this literature review is to examine the potential relationship between air pollution and oral health. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first systematic review endeavoring to compare air pollution and oral health.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Study Characteristics
The article selection process for this review followed the guidelines provided by the PRISMA flow diagram, as shown in Figure 1. A comprehensive search was conducted across PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science databases, spanning 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2023 (a 15-year timeframe was included), resulting in a total of 4983 scientific articles. To eliminate duplicates, the references of the identified records were uploaded to the digital tool Rayyan (http://rayyan.qcri.org, accessed on 23 May 2023). The systematic review is registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews, Prospero, under the identification CRD 42024559844. After duplicate removal, 3477 unique papers remained for further analysis. The titles of these articles were manually reviewed to include relevant references related to the correlation between air pollutants and oral health. Following this screening process, 20 studies were identified as relevant to the topic of air pollutants and their impact on oral health. After that, 9 studies were excluded (did not meet our inclusion criteria); a final selection of 11 scientific papers was made based on their study type and the specific air pollutants examined.

2.2. Search Strategy
This systematic review adhered to the guidelines outlined in the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses) statement and employed the PICO(S) approach (Patient or Population, Intervention, Control or Comparison, Outcome, and Study types). Extensive literature research was conducted using the databases PubMed (Medline), Embase, Web of Knowledge, and Cochrane Library, focusing on the correlation between air pollution and oral health. The search strategy utilized various combinations of keywords, including “Air pollution” OR “environmental” OR “pollution” AND “dental health” OR “oral health”. The PICO question was formulated as follows: P-population: individuals exposed to air pollution; I-intervention: measures undertaken by dental practitioners to comprehend the relationship between air pollution and oral health; C-comparison: no intervention or standard care; and O-outcome: oral health outcomes associated with air pollution such as dental caries, periodontitis, and related conditions. This question specifically investigates the association between air pollution and oral health, as well as the role of dental practitioners in addressing this issue. The search was limited to English-language articles, and publications within a 15-year timeframe were included in the electronic search.
The research questions of this systematic review were:
How many studies have been published on the effects of air pollution on oral health?
What methodological characteristics did the paper publish?
Which air pollutants were commonly investigated?
Is it possible to consider a relation between oral health outcomes and air pollutants?
2.3. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
Articles were considered appropriate when satisfying the following inclusion criteria:
Articles with main topic regarding the correlation between air pollution and their impact on oral health;
Studies performed in vivo;
Full-text paper in English;
Retrospective study, case-control study, cross-sectional study were included.
Articles that did not have the above information were excluded from the review. Research letters and conference proceedings were excluded. Air pollutant exposure of workers in dental clinic/hospital were excluded.
2.4. Data Extraction and Analysis of the Data
All the relevant data were extracted, including the author’s name, publication year, type of study, pollutants measured, and country and impact of oral health. Specifically, a data abstraction sheet was used, and the accuracy of the information was verified by both B.S. and M.S. (in accordance with all the authors). The investigated pollutants were classified as follows:
Gaseous/air pollutants (such as O3 = Ozone; NO = Nitrogen Monoxide; NO2 = Nitrogen Dioxide; SO2 = Sulfur Dioxide; CO = Carbon Monoxide) and particulate matter (i.e., PM10, PM2.5).
3. Results
The 11 selected papers analyzed various air pollutants associated with health-related diseases, including Ozone, Nitrogen Dioxide, Nitrogen Monoxide, Carbon Monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and particulate matter. Notably, particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of ≤10 μm diameters (PM10) and PM2.5 were included in the analysis, as outlined in Table 1. The studies underwent quality assessment utilizing the QUADAS-2 tool, as outlined in Table 1. All publication were classified as having a high risk of bias (Table 2).

How many studies have been published on the effects of air pollution on oral health?
Upon conducting a systematic review, it was found that the initial study exploring the association between oral health and air pollution was published in 2008 in Taiwan. That study specifically investigated the correlation between oral cleft lip, either with or without palate and air pollution. Out of the total of eleven studies reviewed, a significant association between maternal exposure to air pollution and oral clefts was observed in seven studies. However, the primary focus of the authors was to primarily examine pathologies directly related to the oral cavity and within the domain of dental expertise. The first study establishing a relationship between periodontitis and air pollution was published in 2014. Among the eleven studies analyzed, three studies demonstrated an association between periodontitis and air pollution. This finding is summarized in Table 1, indicating an increasing over the past five years in publications suggesting a correlation between periodontitis and air pollution within the last decade. Only one out of the eleven studies reviewed addressed the correlation between oral cancer and air pollution.
What methodological characteristics did the paper publish?
The methodological characteristics are presented in Table 3.
