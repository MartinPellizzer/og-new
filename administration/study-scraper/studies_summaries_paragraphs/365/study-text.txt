Here is a summarized paragraph focusing on ozone-related information and data:

The study evaluates updates to NOAA's online-coupled air quality model version 7 (AQMv7) within the Unified Forecast System, which demonstrates significant improvements in simulating ozone concentrations over the continental United States. The updated model reduces the positive bias of hourly O3 by 50% and 72% for maximum daily 8-hour average O3, respectively, leading to a more accurate representation of O3 levels during both day and night. Spatially, the updates result in lower positive biases of hourly O3 across all ten EPA regions, particularly within the Great Plains. These improvements are achieved through enhanced gas and aerosol chemistry, dry deposition processes, and structural changes to the Input/Output interface, enhancing both computational efficiency and air-surface exchange process representation.
