Here is a detailed summary of the study in 1 paragraph, focusing on information and data related to ozone:

Researchers optimized room temperature ozone sensors using metal halide perovskites, demonstrating a multifaceted approach for sensitivity, stability, and mechanism understanding. Br-rich sensors exhibited p-type response to O3 gas, while Cl-based counterparts showed n-type sensing behavior. Mn-doping significantly enhanced O3 sensing performance by facilitating gas adsorption, supported by both atomistic simulations and experimental evidence. Long-term evaluation revealed evolving sensing behaviors due to dynamic instabilities over time. Optimal halide composition and Mn-doping levels were identified, representing a significant step forward in engineering low-cost, high-performing, and durable room temperature perovskite-based gas sensors.
