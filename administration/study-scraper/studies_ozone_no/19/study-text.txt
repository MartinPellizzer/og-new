Abstract
In the continuous struggle for improvements in laboratory processes, flow synthesis has been widely used for being safer, more reproducible, as for improving yields and scalability. Therefore, flow ozonolysis has become a turning point as flow reactors provides a much safer work environment and reactions can now be produced at industrial scales. In this review we would discuss several reactors used in flow ozonolysis and its importance for the safety of the ozonolysis process.
