The results show that the pseudo first-order rate constant for ozone destruction depends on the surface condition, specifically the surface concentration of atomic oxygen atoms. As the surface concentration of atomic oxygen decreases, the rate constant also decreases. The measured rate constants ranged from 9.0 × 10−5 s−1 to 9.8 × 10−5 s−1.
