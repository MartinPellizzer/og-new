Here is a summary of the study in 1 detailed paragraph, focusing on the information and data related to ozone:

The study explored the production of bioethanol from Sengon wood chip waste (Paraserianthes falcataria) using fungal pretreatment with Trichoderma harzianum and subsequent fermentation with Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The results showed that pretreatment with T. harzianum, followed by ozonolysis and oven drying, achieved a sugar content of 0.6 g/g from the wood chip waste. Furthermore, combining pretreatment with ozone and T. harzianum resulted in an even higher sugar yield of 0.5 g/g. The highest ethanol content was obtained at 0.47Â±0.000 g/g with added yeast nutrients (YE) at a rate of 1 gr/L, and a fermentation duration of 72 hours. These findings suggest that the combination of fungal pretreatment and ozone treatment is an effective method for producing bioethanol from Sengon wood chip waste.
