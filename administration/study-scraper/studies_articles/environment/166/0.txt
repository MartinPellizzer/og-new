Assessing the long-term tropospheric ozone (O3) distributions and trends is crucial for understanding the impact of human activity and climate change on atmospheric chemistry. The tropospheric O3 budget derived from models and observations shows an increase in ozone in the troposphere, with regional variations observed. However, uncertainties persist as to the validity of trends deduced from satellite data, due to discrepancies between ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) instruments. This study aims to analyze the spatio-temporal evolution of daytime and nighttime IASI O3 concentrations using a long-term record of both IASI and CrIS ozone datasets.
