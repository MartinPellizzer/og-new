The results showed that applying the ozonation process to fruits led to a reduction in microbiological load (fermentation bacteria count reduction by 3.4 log cfuâˆ’1), resulting in an extension of their shelf life and a reduction in storage losses (8.98% by mass). The implementation of the developed solution contributed to tangible benefits for producers and distributors, including reduced water loss and limiting fruit losses during storage.
