Air pollution is a pressing environmental issue that poses significant threats to human health and plant growth. The increasing levels of ozone (O3), nitrogen oxides (NOX), and particulate matter (PM) in urban environments have been linked to various negative impacts on plants, including reduced photosynthesis, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and altered gene expression. Despite these challenges, plants have evolved complex mechanisms to tolerate air pollution, and understanding these responses is crucial for developing sustainable solutions.
