Here are five detailed paragraphs based on the scientific study:

**Paragraph 1**
Air pollution is a significant environmental health concern that has severe impacts on atmospheric visibility, local climate, and human health. In this study, we analyzed the spatiotemporal characteristics of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone (O3) concentrations in Korla, an oasis city in northeastern Tarim Basin, China. The study aimed to investigate the seasonal and daily variations in air pollutant concentrations, as well as the relationship between Air Quality Index (AQI) and PM concentrations.

**Paragraph 2**
The data used in this study was obtained from three state-controlled monitoring stations in Korla from January 2016 to December 2023. The AQI was calculated according to the Technical Provisions on Ambient Air Quality Index (for Trial Implementation) [HJ 633-2012] and Air Quality Standards" (GB 3095-2012). We employed Origin 2021 software to visualize the characteristic curves of spatiotemporal changes in each pollutant, along with their corresponding percentages. Additionally, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted using SPSS 26.0 to test differences in PM2.5, PM10, and O3 data between sites and temporal variations within sites.

**Paragraph 3**
The results showed that the concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, and O3 in Korla exhibited a cyclical trend from 2016 to 2023. PM10 concentrations exceeded the national ambient air quality standard (GB3095-2012 Level 2) all-year round, while PM2.5 concentrations only exceeded the standard in spring. The AQI data series showed strong positive wavelet coherence with PM concentrations, suggesting that the AQI can effectively characterize fluctuating trends in PM concentrations.

**Paragraph 4**
The findings of this study highlight the importance of strengthening measures to prevent and control air pollution in Korla. The high levels of PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations suggest that sand and dust have a substantial influence on air quality, posing potential threats to human health. Furthermore, the strong positive wavelet coherence between AQI and PM concentrations indicates that the AQI can be used as an effective indicator for monitoring air pollution.

**Paragraph 5**
In conclusion, this study provides valuable insights into the spatiotemporal characteristics of air pollutant concentrations in Korla. The results suggest that it is essential to implement measures to prevent and control sand and dust pollution, as well as to promote urban greening and restrict emissions within city areas. Additionally, future studies should investigate the impact of air pollution on human health in Korla, as well as the effectiveness of different control strategies. By doing so, we can improve air quality conditions and protect public health in this arid oasis city.
