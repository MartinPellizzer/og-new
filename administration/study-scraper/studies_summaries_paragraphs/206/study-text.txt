Here is a detailed summary of the study in 1 paragraph, focusing on information and data related to ozone:

A case report presented multimodal therapy for managing osteonecrosis associated with cancer medication (MRONJ) through the use of topical antimicrobials, Antimicrobial Photodynamic Therapy, systemic antibiotics, and ozone therapy. A 45-year-old female patient with malignant breast neoplasm and using bisphosphonate Zometa was diagnosed with MRONJ after tooth extraction. The patient underwent multimodal therapy for 46 months, resulting in regression of the condition. Ozone therapy was used as an adjunctive treatment to promote healing and reduce infection. The study highlights the importance of ozone therapy in the management of MRONJ, as it has been shown to have anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties, promoting wound healing and tissue regeneration.
