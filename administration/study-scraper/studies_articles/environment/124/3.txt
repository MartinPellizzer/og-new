The findings suggest that impaired telomere homeostasis may contribute to O3 exposure-related IR via inhibition of glycogen synthesis and acceleration of gluconeogenesis. These mechanisms are supported by the mouse model experiment, which showed changes in glucose metabolism and telomere dynamics in response to O3 exposure. Further studies are needed to fully elucidate the specific mechanisms underlying this relationship.
