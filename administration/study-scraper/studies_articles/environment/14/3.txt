The discussion highlights the importance of accurately representing VOC reactivity in inventories to determine the effectiveness of future NOx reduction policies. The study's findings suggest that VCPs are a significant contributor to urban ozone formation, while cooking emissions play a comparable role. The results also emphasize the need for more research on the impact of VCPs and cooking emissions on atmospheric chemistry.
