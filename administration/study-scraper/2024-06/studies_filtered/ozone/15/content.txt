Abstract
Tropospheric ozone is a significant air pollutant with severe adverse effects on human health. The complex dynamics of ozone formation, distribution, and health impacts underscore the need for a comprehensive understanding of this pollutant. Despite well-documented health risks, including an estimated 423,100 deaths annually due to ozone exposure, millions of people in major countries continue to be exposed to unhealthy levels. Notably, the epidemiological evidence linking long-term ozone exposure to health outcomes is limited compared to short-term exposure studies, leaving some findings incomplete. Regulatory standards vary globally, with the implementation of the World Health Organization recommendation for an 8-h average limit of 50 ppb to protect public health remaining heterogeneous, leading to significant disparities in adoption across countries, and often significantly higher. Emissions from diesel and gasoline vehicles are major sources of VOCs and NOx in urban areas, and their reduction is a key strategy. Additionally, climate change may exacerbate ozone pollution through increased natural precursor emissions, leading to higher ground-level ozone in polluted regions, like the eastern US, southern Europe, and parts of Asia. Addressing tropospheric ozone effectively requires an integrated approach that considers both natural and anthropogenic sources to reduce concentrations and mitigate health impacts.

1. The Ozone Paradox: “Good” in the Stratosphere, “Bad” in the Troposphere
Ozone is a molecule formed by three oxygen atoms (O3). It exists naturally in tiny quantities high up in the atmosphere, known as the stratosphere. Here, ozone acts as a guardian, filtering out the harmful ultraviolet rays from the sun, protecting life on Earth. However, closer to the ground, in the troposphere, ozone forms through chemical reactions between pollutants released by vehicles, fuel vapors, and various industrial processes. Unfortunately, at ground level, high concentrations of ozone become poisonous to both humans and plants.
1.1. Stratospheric “Good” Ozone
Ninety percent of our planet’s ozone resides in the stratosphere, a region stretching roughly 10 to 50 km above us. This natural ozone layer is a delicate balance between sunlight creating ozone and chemical reactions breaking it down. Sunlight acts like a knife, splitting regular oxygen molecules (O2) into single oxygen atoms. These lone atoms can either recombine back into O2 or partner with an existing O2 molecule to form ozone (O3). Unfortunately, ozone can also be destroyed by reactions with molecules containing nitrogen, hydrogen, chlorine, or bromine. While some of these ozone-destroying molecules occur naturally, human activities have introduced others.
High above us, ozone acts as a vital shield, absorbing the brunt of the sun’s harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Without this protective layer, the Earth’s surface would be bombarded by intense UV rays, rendering it virtually sterile. Thankfully, ozone acts as a powerful filter, completely blocking out the most energetic UV-C radiation and absorbing most of the damaging UV-B rays. While it allows some UV-A radiation through, it still filters out a significant portion.
Humanity’s growing use of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) has disrupted the delicate balance in the stratosphere. These synthetic gases have accelerated the rate of ozone destruction, causing a concerning decline in its overall levels. This thinning of the ozone layer allows more harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation to reach Earth’s surface.
When scientists refer to the “ozone hole”, they are specifically addressing this worrying depletion of the “good” ozone layer residing high up in the stratosphere.
The consequences of excessive UV-B and UV-A exposure are severe. These rays can cause painful sunburn and lead to serious health problems, like skin cancer and eye damage. By acting as a critical barrier, ozone safeguards life on Earth from the sun’s relentless assault [1].
1.2. Tropospheric “Bad” Ozone
While stratospheric ozone acts as a protective shield for life on Earth, ground-level ozone poses a significant threat to both plants and animals, including humans [2,3]. This “bad” ozone forms near the Earth’s surface in a toxic tango between nitrogen oxide gases (released from vehicles and industries) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs)—chemicals that readily evaporate into the air, like paint thinners.
Naturally, the troposphere (the lower atmosphere) contains minimal ozone, around 10 parts per billion (a mere 0.000001%). However, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) warns that ozone concentrations exceeding 70 parts per billion for over 8 h pose a health risk [4]. These unhealthy levels often occur in or around cities during periods of warm, stagnant air. This “bad” ozone can irritate throats and lungs, worsening conditions like asthma and emphysema. A recent study found that over 4 out of 10 cities globally (more than 40%) faced unhealthy levels of ozone (O3) ranging from 40 to 60 micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m3). These cities were mainly concentrated in China and India. The research also revealed significant seasonal variations in ozone levels worldwide. Summer had the highest average concentration (45.6 µg/m3), followed by spring (47.3 µg/m3), autumn (38.0 µg/m3), and winter (33.6 µg/m3). Looking at exposure, the analysis showed that roughly 12.2% of the population in 261 cities lived in areas with high ozone concentrations (80–160 µg/m3). This translates to approximately 36.32 million people in major countries being exposed to unhealthy ozone levels [5]. Regulatory standards and health guidelines vary across different global areas, with the WHO and India adopting stricter values to protect public health, which equate to 50 ppb over an 8-h average. Table 1 shows regulatory values for ozone in parts per billion (ppb) for various regions and averaging times [6,7,8].

2. Emissions of Tropospheric Ozone
Tropospheric ozone, a powerful oxidant and major component of photochemical smog, is not emitted directly into the atmosphere. Rather, it is formed through complex chemical reactions involving ozone precursors, such as nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), in the presence of sunlight. The sources of these precursors can be either natural or anthropogenic, both contributing significantly to the formation of ambient ozone.
2.1. Natural Sources
Natural emissions of ozone precursors include biogenic VOCs, emitted mainly by vegetation, and NOx produced by natural events, such as lightning and soil microbial activities. Forests, in particular, release a variety of VOCs, such as isoprene and monoterpenes, which are crucial for ozone formation. For example, tropical forests are known to emit large quantities of isoprene, which reacts rapidly with NOx in the presence of sunlight, significantly increasing ozone concentrations. In addition, lightning produces NOx through the thermal dissociation of nitrogen molecules, which then combine with oxygen to form nitrogen oxides, an important precursor to ozone. Oceanic and soil processes also contribute, albeit to a lesser extent, to natural VOC and NOx emissions. A recent review indicated that future research on the factors affecting the formation of NOx and VOCs in the soil environment is essential for enhancing our understanding of the role of the soil environment in the formation of ground-level ozone [9]. Climate change could exacerbate ozone pollution through enhanced natural precursor emissions, increased stratospheric-tropospheric exchange, stagnant weather, methane emission changes, and elevated carbon dioxide levels [10]. Future climate change is expected to significantly impact ozone levels, especially due to rising temperatures and increased moisture in the atmosphere. This could lead to higher ozone concentrations near the ground in polluted regions, like eastern US, southern Europe, and parts of Asia. However, the understanding of how climate change will affect ozone levels is incomplete, and existing models may not fully capture the complex interactions at play [11].
2.2. Anthropogenic Sources
Human activities are a significant source of NOx and VOCs, contributing significantly to tropospheric ozone formation, especially in urban and industrialized areas. Diesel and gasoline vehicles emissions are a major source of VOCs and NOx in cities, where heavy traffic releases large quantities of these precursors (5). Figure 1 shows the source contributions of the six identified factors for VOCs and NOx in a typical industrial city in China, which are industrial process, biogenic source, coal combustion, solvent utilization, diesel vehicle emission, and gasoline vehicle emission. In this study, diesel and gasoline vehicle emissions were the major contributors to VOCs (44.60%) and NOx (45.70%) [12]. Motor vehicles are a major source of NOx and VOCs in cities, where heavy traffic releases large quantities of these precursors [13]. Industry and energy production, through the combustion of fossil fuels, are another important source of NOx [14]. Industrial emissions also include VOCs from processes such as oil refining, chemical production, and other manufacturing activities [15]. In residential and commercial areas, heating and the use of solvents and other chemicals further contribute to VOC emissions [16].

2.3. Photochemical Reactions
The formation of ozone in the lower atmosphere is the result of a series of photochemical reactions involving precursors emitted from both natural and anthropogenic sources. These reactions begin with the photolysis of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) under sunlight, which produces atomic oxygen (O). This atomic oxygen then reacts with molecular oxygen (O2) to form ozone (O3). VOCs play a crucial role in this process, reacting with free radicals to produce additional NO2, which further fuels ozone production in a continuous cycle.
2.4. Spatial and Temporal Variations
Ozone concentrations vary significantly depending on time and location. During the summer months, when sunlight is more intense and temperatures are higher, photochemical reactions are faster, leading to higher ozone levels. Urban areas, with high concentrations of traffic and industrial activities, tend to have higher ozone levels than rural areas, although long-distance transport can carry ozone and its precursors to remote regions, contributing to high ozone levels even far from emission sources. While ozone levels have decreased in rural areas since the 1990s, they have conversely increased in urban areas, with a stronger trend toward these contrasting changes since 2005, and variations existing across different regions. Regional differences in ozone trends, primarily driven by reductions in NOx and VOC emissions through legislation implemented over the past 30 years, have resulted in significant downward trends in hourly peak O3 concentrations at most monitoring sites worldwide [17].
3. Exposure to Tropospheric Ozone
3.1. Measuring and Monitoring Tropospheric Ozone
The monitoring and measurement of tropospheric ozone is essential to understanding the dynamics of its formation, distribution, and impacts on human health and the environment. This process involves a combination of ground-based measurement techniques, satellite observations, and air-quality models, each of which provides crucial complementary data for a comprehensive assessment of ozone in the lower atmosphere.
3.1.1. Ground Measurements
Ground measurements are the most direct and detailed method of monitoring ozone concentrations
