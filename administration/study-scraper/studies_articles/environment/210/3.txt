Discussion of the results revealed that photocatalytic ozonation offers a promising approach to advanced chemical wastewater treatment. The formation of hydroxyl radicals enabled non-specific oxidation of pollutants, while the combination with ozonation enhanced efficiency. However, technical challenges remain in constructing effective photocatalytic reactors and optimizing process conditions.
