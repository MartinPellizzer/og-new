The discussion focuses on the spatial distribution of VOC emissions and their relation to O3 formation. The results showed that Marylebone and Eltham sites are impacted by local sources, mainly from traffic, while Chilbolton and Auchencorth have VOC sources from wider geographical areas. The PSCF analysis suggested that VOC emissions were relatively low at the Chilbolton and Auchencorth sites, while emissions were high at Marylebone. The spatial distribution characteristics of OFP were similar to those of VOC emissions.
