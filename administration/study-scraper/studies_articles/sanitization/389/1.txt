The study employed a randomized controlled trial design, where 20 white laboratory rats were divided into two groups. Group 1 breathed an ozone-containing mixture for 7 days, each session lasting 15 minutes, while group 2 breathed a steam-water ozone-containing mixture for the same duration. The ozone supply was 500 mg/h, which exceeds the maximum permissible concentration by a factor of 2. The animals were withdrawn from the experiment on the 3rd, 7th, and 14th days, and histological examination was performed on their organs.
