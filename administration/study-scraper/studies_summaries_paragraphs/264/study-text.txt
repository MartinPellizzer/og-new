Here is a summarized paragraph focusing on ozone information and data:

The study analyzed four years of continuous observation data from a typical urban site in China to investigate ozone (O3) pollution control. Results showed that transport and dispersion significantly impact O3 concentration, with positive contributions ranging from 12.9% to 24.0% during the warm season. After normalizing for meteorological conditions, the sensitivity of O3 formation shifted from a NOx-limited regime to a transition regime between VOC- and NOx-limited regimes. Vehicle exhaust became the primary source of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emissions after removing dispersion effects, contributing 41.8% during pollution periods, while combustion decreased its contribution from 33.7% to 25.1%. These findings provide new insights for implementing O3 pollution control measures and evaluating emission reduction effectiveness in urban areas.
