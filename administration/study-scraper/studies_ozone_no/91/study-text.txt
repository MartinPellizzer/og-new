Abstract: The very short-lived bromine containing substances are source gases ofstratospheric bromine that contribute also to stratospheric ozonedepletion. The surface emissions of of these VSLS are still a factorof uncertainty in global modelling of atmospheric chemistry. Weintroduce results employing a top-down method to improve the estimatesof surface emissions.Simulations are performed using the Lagrangian chemical transportmodel CLaMS, that needed to be updated to include VSLS chemistry andto employ surface emission rates at the lower boundary. Based on theemission inventory by Ordonez et al (2012), we define surface origintracers that trace the air from certain areas defined by ocean, coastand land. We compare model results with recent aircraft-borneobservations by GhOST on the German research aircraft HALO andTOGA-TOF on the US research aircraft NSF NCAR GV. To enhance the datacoverage, we also use a climatology compiled from multiple previousaircraft campaigns since 2009.For the optimization of the surface emission inventory for CH2Br2 andCHBr3, the differences between model results and observations arecorrelated with these surface origin tracers and the differences tothe Ordonez inventory are presented.
