Here are five detailed paragraphs based on the scientific study:

**Paragraph 1**
The selection of Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) methods has a significant impact on the results of Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs). With multiple LCIA methods available, practitioners face challenges in choosing the most suitable method for their studies. To address this issue, this research compares four commonly used multi-impact LCIA methods: ReCiPe 2016, ILCD 2011, CML-IA baseline, and IMPACT 2002+ at the midpoint level. The study applies these methods to a case study of the electricity consumption mix in Europe to evaluate their effects on LCA results.

**Paragraph 2**
The research employed a cradle-to-gate Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) model for the electricity consumption mix in the EU-27, Norway, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. The functional unit was set at 1 megajoule of electricity. The system boundary encompassed processes from raw material extraction to electricity production and distribution. The life cycle inventory data included electricity consumption by sector and source. The four LCIA methods were applied to the LCA model, and the results were compared.

**Paragraph 3**
The comparison of LCIA results showed significant disparities in certain impact categories, such as ozone formation/respiratory organics, particulate matter/respiratory inorganics, ecotoxicity, and water consumption. However, consistent rankings of environmental profiles were observed across most impact categories, with only a few exceptions. Contribution analysis revealed the crucial role of specific substances in each area.

**Paragraph 4**
The methodological choices during LCIA significantly influenced the characterisation results in absolute values. Nevertheless, similar conclusions were drawn regarding the ranking of environmental profiles for most impact categories. Large discrepancies between LCIA methods arose from differences in geographical differentiation, scope of impact categories, and contribution of specific environmental flows to a given result. Therefore, practitioners must carefully select their LCIA method and impact categories based on the goal and scope definition.

**Paragraph 5**
This research highlights the importance of considering methodological choices during LCIA when interpreting LCA results. The comparison of four widely used LCIA methods demonstrates that different methods can lead to varying conclusions. Practitioners should be aware of these differences to ensure accurate and reliable results in their studies. The findings of this research support practitioners in selecting suitable LCIA methods for their case studies, thus facilitating more informed decision-making in environmental management.
