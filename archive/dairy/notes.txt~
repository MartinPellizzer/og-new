MILK
====================================================

contaminations causes:
- udder
	- within the udder
	- from the udder surface during milking
	- milking equipment
	- human
	- animal
	- soil
	- feces
	--------------------------
	- (bacterial flora of milk can vary and depend primarly on hygiene
	  practices of milking)
	- environment of cow housing
	- environment of cow milking
	- procedures to clean and sanitize the milking and storage equipment
	- health and hygiene of the cow

contaminations bacteria:
	1. pathogenic bacteria
	2. spoliage bacteria
	3. beneficial bacteria
	---------------------------
	- pasteurization inactivates most pathogenic bacteria
	- pasteurization does not inactivate all spoliage bacteria (eg, some
	  sporeforming bacteria), 
	- or some enzymes produced prior to pasturization

pathogenic bacteria:
	- listeria spp.
	- shiga-toxin E. coli (STEC)
	- s. aureus
	- sporeformers (bacillus spp. and clostridia)
	- salmonella spp.
	----------------------------
	- listeria monocytogenes
		- listeriosis (20%-30% mortality rate), low prevelance
		- l. monocytogenes is the only species associated with human
		  illness
		- usually too low in milk (<10cfu/mL)
		- usually present because of cross-contamination from
		  environment
		- some cases of contamination for udder infections
		- a single cow in a herd of 160 cows can contaminate the
		  entire bulk milk with L. monocytogenens...
		- ... even ate an excretion level of 300 cfu/ml by that cow
		- reducing growth in the bulk-tank is best achieved by short
		  residence time
		- use milk immediately after milking for cheese manufacture
	- pathogenic e. coli
		- general e. coli are primarely harmless bacteria
			- they colonize the intestinal tract of human/animals
			- they do not survive well in the einvironment
			- sometimes used as indication of recent fecal
			  contamination
		- can contaminate milk from the udder during milking
		- there is a small group of e. coli that are pathogenic and
		  can can produce toxins
			- such stx1, and stx2
		- verocytotoxigenic e. coli (vtec also stec)
			- e. coli serogroup O157 is the most widely known
			- others O26, O91
		- occurence in milk is between 0-2% of samples
		- even with low initial levels of inoculation...
			- e. coli O157:H7 can grow during cheese manufacture
			- and survive during chees ripening at levels high
			  enough to be considered a public health threat
		- the absence of e. coli in milk for chees manufacture is
		  necessary (especially where there is no inactivation process)
		- such as pasteurization
	- salmonella
		- salmonellosis most common and widely distributed foodborn
		  diseases caused by salmonella
		- salmonella: 2500 different serotypes or serovars
		- ubiquitous and hardy bacteria 
		- can survive for several weeks in a dry environment
		- and several months in water
		- all sertypes can cause disease in humans
		- but only a few are host-specific and can reside in only one
		  of a few animal species
		- ex. salmonella enterica serotype Dublin is found in cattle
		- whchi is often invasive and can be life threatening
		- salmonella strains cause gastrenteritis (often dont need
		  treatment), 
		- but can be severe in young, elderly, and patientes with weak
		  immunity
		- this group includes salmonella enterica serotype Enteritidis
		  and s. enterica serotype typhimurium
	- staphylococcus aureus
		- coagulase-positive s. aureus cause clinical and sbclinical
		  mastitis in lactating animals
		- contaminate raw milk during milking
		- milk and dairy products can also be contaminated by strains
		  of human origin
		- sometimes the most frequent pathogen in raw milk cheese
		- it the toxin produced by c-p s. a. that is dangerous, not
		  the bacteria itself
		- sa. produce a wide range of toxing and 21 staphylococal
		  enterotoxins (SEs) or enterotoxing-like proteins are found
		- the toxins staphylococcla enterotoxins A (SEA) and AED are
		  most frequentl yassociated with food
		- SEC is associated with animal origin, so for milk and cheese
		  SEC must be considered too
		- not all strains of cpsa. have the ability to produce toxins
		- many factors can inhibit toxin production
			- pH
			- temperature
			- salt concentration
			- etc.
		- you need about 10^5 cfu/ml of milk or 10^5 cfu/g of cheese
		  to have enough toxins to cause illness
		- cpsa. are poor competitors, their opportunity to grow is
		  limited
		- especially if a competing starter culture bacteria is added
		  at an early stage
		- cpsa. is killed by pasteurization or inactivated during
		  cheese ripening, but their toxin stay stable
		- this is dangerous because you can detect low number of cpsa.
		  during ripening while high concentration of toxin can be
		- so sample cheese cpsa. immediately after manufacture
		- if numbers are 10^5 cfu/g of cheese, also take a toxin test,
		  if numbers are low, there is no issue
	- mycobacteria
		- mycobacterium bovis
			- tubercolosis
		- mycobacterium avium subspecies paratubercolosis (MAP)
			- johne's disease in cattle 
		- m. bovis raise concerns, because if the milk from a herd
		  that fails the test for tubercolosis...
		- ... has been used for raw milk cheese manufacture, ...
		- there is a risk that the cheese will contain M. bovis
		- no clear studies on the number of m. bovis in milk of a
		  tuberculosis-infected cow
		- no clear link between MAP and Chron's disease
		- MAP number into milk are relaively low (10-560cfu/ml)
			- estimated by PRC
			- usually overestimated comparing to culture methods
		- MAP survives raw milk cheesemaking and ripening, if present
		  in milk
	- brucella
		- brucella spp, pathogenic to animals and humans
		- causes brucellosis
		- transmitted by ingesting contaminated food
			- such as unpasteurized milk products
			- direct contact with an infected animal
			- inhalation of aerosols
		- direct trasnmission from human to human is very rare but
		  possible
		- minimum infectious dose is 10-100 organisms
		- intracellular pathogens (cant replicate outside the host
		  organism)
		- premature abortion in cattle
		- spread from wild populations to domestic cattle
		- transferred from animals to human host and remain pathogenic
		- in human, brucellosis cause acute and chronic symptoms
			- treated with antibiotics
		- don't have usual virulence characeristis of pathoges
			- the firulence mechanism is no fully understood

spoliage bacteria:
	- tend to be postpaseurization contaminants
	- spore-forming and nonspore-forming bacteria that survive
	  pasterurization and grow at <10Â°C are concerning too
	- analysis time for these bacteria is several days
	--------------------------------------------------
	- spore-forming bacteria
		- species bacillus and clostridium
		- survive pasteurization
		- are pathogenic
		- usually consider primarly spoliage
		- clostridium botulinum and bacillus anthracis are phatogens
		- but rarely associated with milk
		- and few strains of B. cereus are pathogenic
	- psychrotrophic bacteria
		- grow at refrigeration temperatures
		- most are killed by pasterurization
		- present in milk as postpasteurization due to lack
		  of sanitization
		- some are thermoduric and survive pasteurization
		- great concern in dairy those who survive pasteur and grow at
		  low storage temperature in milk
	- pseudomonas
		- generally inactivated by pasteur
		- but can contaminate post-pasteur
		- great metabolic diversity
		- grow low temp
		- many species can cause spoliage
		- in dairy are a great concern

beneficial organisms:
	- microflora of
	- lactic acid bacteria
	- milk selection is not based on the identification of beneficial
	  organisms

detection methods for bacteria in milk:
	- total bacteria count (TBC) is best indicator of quality
	- low tbc is good quality
	- many methods to know tbc in few hours
	- low tbc does not correlate with low numbers of a specific organism
	- increasingly important to have low numbers of specific bacteria
	- current methods of specific bacteria identificatio are cutlure
	  methods
		- require several days
		- not appropriate for product manufacture, they take too long
	- molecular methods (such as polymerase chain reaction, PCR)
		- results in less than 12h
		- may be appropriate for food manufacture
	- PCR can detect specific bacteria
		- or undesired metabolic compounds
		- are becoming increasingly more available
		- in future widely used
	- PCR examples:
		- VTEC
			- dna-based methods
			- ddetect genes encoding pathogenicity and virulence
			  factors
			- stx1, stx2, eae, EhlyA, in ecoly
			- iso 13136
			- still has a risk perspecctive (prevalence vs
			  occurend)
		- biogenic amines
			- produces by a wider range of bacteria
			- toxicological consequences
			- in fermentd foods
			- milk major source of contaminaiton
			- need rapid detection
			- with culture-base methods detiection need 3 days
			- endpoint PCR and quantitative PCR are being used
			- PCR in 4 hours, sensitive and specific detection and
			  enumeration
		- b. cereus and sulfite-reducing clostridia (SRC)
			- bacillus cereus has six related species difficult to
			  differentiate, even by molecular methods
			- SRC is difficult too
			- current methods take 3 days, arn not suitable

control of bacteria in milk:
	- prevention is the best cure
	- hygiene
		- essential to maintain lot TBC
		- there are guidelines
		- prevention of cross-contamination from cow udder during
		  milking
		- effetctive use of cleaning practices for milking machines
	- preventative maintenance:
		- milking equip, including bulk milk storage tank,
		- adequate cleaning
		- reduce mastitis
	- animal health:
		- free from hunger and thirst
		- free from discomfort
		- free from pain, injury, disease, 
		- free to express normal behabior
		- free from fear and distress
		- these freedoms increse the quality of milk, and reduce
		  pathogen contamination

removal or inhibition of bacterial spores:
	- removal of spores from cheese milk
		- achieved with bactofugation or microfiltration
		- bactofugation is a centrifugal process
			- (~9000g)
			- reduce number of anaerobic spore-forming bacteria
			- 55-60 degrees C in series (downstream) of milk
			  separation and standardization
			- 80%-90% removal of total bacteria
			- 98%-99.5% removal of clostridial spores in the
			  centrifugate
			- this constitute 0.15-o.3% of the milk fed
			- discharged periodically 
			- or diluted with bactofuged milk to 2-3% of the feed
			  volume and then setilized
			- eg. 120 degree C fo 60 s or 140 C for 3-4 s
			- then recombined with the bactofuged milk stream
		- the bactocatch process
			- prior separation of milk into cream and skim milk
			  streams
			- skim milk is microfiltrated using 0.8-1.4 um poer
			  size membranes at 37-50C
			- redult in a bacteria-spore rich concentrate
			  (retentate)
			- with 5% to the flow (or 0.5% if a second MF is done)
			- and a bacteria-spore reduced stream (permeate)
			- the retentate may be added to the cream stream prior
			  to UHT treatment of the latter at 120C
			- result in inactivation of bacteria and clostridial
			  spores
			- followed by mixing with the permeate stream, HTST
			  pasteurization, and cheese manufacture.
			- a reduciton of 4-5 log ccles of spores is possible
			  using this system

inibition of spore germination and/or bacterial growth
	- cheese starter cutlure with high acid-producing activity 
	- avoid inadequate pressing of the curd which may result in weak areas
	  in the curd
	- or unexpelled whey pockets which could establish conditions for the
	  formatio nof gas holes
	- use of compounds (nitrate, lysozyme, nisin), not uneversally
	  permitted to inhibit spore germination and bacterial growth
	- nitrate
		- added to delay germination of spores in cheese
		- until the salt addet to the outer region of cheese has
		  equilibrated with the cheese
		- requires presence of xanthine oxidoreductase (EC 1.2.3.2)
		- which reduce nitrate to nitrite
		- inibitory action by NaCl
		- used with initial chees pH suitable against butyric acid
		  fermentation
		- optinma growth of Cl. tyrobutyricum at pH 5.8
		- with slow equilibration of salt from cheese surface inward
		- Ducth-type and Swiss-type cheeses
		- add nitrate to a mixture of curds and whay
		- quantity of nitrate depends of number of spores present, pH,
		  and slt-in-moisutre level 
		- L-type or O-type starter bacteria reduce risk of butyric
		  acid fermentation compared to DL type
			- because of production of acetate
			- L-type: cirase positive Leuconostoc meseteroides
			  subsp. cremoris
			- O-type: Cit- L. lactis subsp. lactis and cremoris
			- DL type: Cit+ Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp.
			  cremoris and Cit+ L. lactis subsp. lactis
		- conversely, high coliform (> 10^5 cfu/g) increse risk of
		  butyric acid fermentation
			- due to degradation of nitrate to nitrite early in
			  cheese ripening
			- same effect in some strains of mesophilic
			  lactobacilli
	- lysozyme (muraminidase)
		- lysozyme hydrolyses peptidoglycan
			- component of bacterial cell wall
			- prompte cell lysis
		- some spores are resistant to lysosyme, others are inhigited
		- added and retained at 90%-99% prevent butyric acid ferm.
			- without inhigiting acidification by lactic acid
			  bacteria
			- and the propionic acid fermtentaion
		- limited use where spore are low (< 500 spores/L)
			- as a small number of Clostridia can survive
			- and highr doses impact negatively the desired lactic
			  and propionic acid fermentations
		- used in combination with bactofugation and is alternative to
		  nitrate
		- where nitrate is permitted, lysozyme may be used in
		  combination to reduce dose of nitrate
	- nisin
		- antibacterial peptide containing 32 amino acid residues
		- bread-spectrum bacteriocin
		- effective against Gram-positive organisms
			- including Clostridium spp.
		- prevent spoliage of processed chessese produced from blends
		  of natural chesses and other ingredients (heated to 80C)
		- this heat treatment does not inactivate spores
		- and when processded chesses are stored at upt ot abieitnt
		  temperature and with suitable Ph and aw
			- germination of pores and growth of vegetative cells
			  can occur
			- leading to utyric acid fem and bas blowing
		- long chain polyphostates have also been shown to inibit the
		  growth of Cl. tyrobutyricum in processed cheese
		- nisin in natural chees in more problematic
			- is lost in whey and inibitory to lactic acid
			  bacteria
		- maybe adjunct bacteriocin-producing Lactovacillus cultures
		  to prevent late blowing in brine-salte cheeses
		- necessary that these cultures do not inhibit starter
		  cultures
			- but be still high enough to produce levels of
			  bacteriocin that inhibit the spores germinaiton
		- also, bacteriocin-producing cultures should not have a
		  deleterious effect on chees flavor during riening
