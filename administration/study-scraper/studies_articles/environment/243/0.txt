This study presents a Marvel analysis of high-resolution spectra of ozone ($^{16}$O$_{3}$) to obtain accurate rotation-vibration (ro-vibrational) energy levels in its ground electronic $\Tilde{X} ^{1}A_{1}$ state. The analysis is performed on measured line position data published in scientific literature, which provides a comprehensive understanding of the molecular structure and behavior of ozone. This study aims to validate the existing knowledge by comparing the results with effective Hamiltonian (EH) energy levels and variational nuclear motion calculations.
