The present study utilized total ozone data from the Geophysics station, measured by a Dobson spectrometer over a nearly decade-long period, alongside solar radiation intensities at the same station. This data was used to calculate UV Erythema radiation (UV index) using solar zenith angle and total ozone data acquired by a Dobson total ozone measuring system at the Geophysics Station.
