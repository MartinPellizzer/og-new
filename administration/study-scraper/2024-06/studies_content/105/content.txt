Abstract
Based on ozone (O3) monitoring data for Xiangtan and meteorological observation data for 2020–2022, we examined ozone pollution characteristics and the effects of meteorological factors on daily maximum 8-h average ozone (O3-8h) concentrations in Xiangtan. Thus, we observed significant increases as well as notable seasonal variations in O3-8h concentrations in Xiangtan during the period considered. The ozone and temperature change response slope (KO3-T) indicated that local emissions had no significant effect on O3-8h generation. Further, average O3-8h concentration and maximum temperature (Tmax) values showed a polynomial distribution. Specifically, at Tmax < 27 °C, it increased almost linearly with increasing temperature, and at Tmax between 27 and 37 °C, it showed an upward curvilinear trend as temperature increased, but at a much lower rate. Then, at Tmax > 37 °C, it decreased with increasing temperature. With respect to relative humidity (RH), the average O3-8h concentration primarily exceeded the standard value when RH varied in the range of 45–65%, which is the key humidity range for O3 pollution, and the inflection point for the correlation curve between O3-8h concentration and RH appeared at ~55%. Furthermore, at wind speeds (WSs) below 1.5 m∙s−1, O3-8h concentration increased rapidly, and at WSs in the 1.5–2 m∙s−1 range, it increased at a much faster rate. However, at WSs > 2 m∙s−1, it decreased slowly with increasing WS. O3-8h concentration also showed the tendency to exceed the standard value when the dominant wind directions in Xiangtan were easterly or southeasterly.
