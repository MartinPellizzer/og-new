Here is a summary of the study in 1 detailed paragraph, focusing on the information related to ozone:

This study examined the effects of elevated ozone (O3) concentrations and warming on rice stem lodging resistance under open-field conditions. The results showed that elevated O3 concentrations (E-O3) significantly reduced stem height, tiller number, panicle weight per stem, and pushing resistance of rice, with a 32% reduction in intact plants and 18% in single stems. E-O3 also decreased various basal internode traits, including breaking resistance, bending moment, culm wall thickness, cross-sectional area, and dry weight per unit length. However, warming treatment (WT) partially mitigated the negative effects of O3 on lodging resistance, possibly due to the reduced load imposed on the basal internodes. The study highlights that elevated O3 concentrations have a significant impact on rice stem lodging resistance, which can be exacerbated by climate change, and suggests that warming may have a mitigating effect on these impacts.
