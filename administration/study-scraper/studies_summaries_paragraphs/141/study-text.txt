Here is a detailed summary of the study in one paragraph:

This study presents an evaluation of stratospheric ozone profile trends from various observational records at multiple sites post-2000. The analysis combines vertical ozone profiles from NOAA's Dobson Network via the Umkehr method, ozonesondes, and satellite-based COH records. Trend consistency across different observational records is a key finding, supporting understanding of the recovery of the ozone layer after the Montreal Protocol implementation. In the mid to upper stratosphere, Northern Hemispheric Umkehr records show positive trends (~+2 %/decade) while COH satellite records exhibit more positive but agreeable trends within uncertainty limits. Lower stratospheric trends are mostly negative (except for OHP ozonesonde data), with large uncertainties.
