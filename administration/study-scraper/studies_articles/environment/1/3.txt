The discussion highlights associations between ozone levels and ozone precursor levels, particularly for nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The results suggest that regional O3 reductions are influential for O3 levels during the Mar-Apr COVID-19 lockdown period. The study's findings provide insights into understanding the intricate relationship among anthropogenic emissions, seasonal fluctuations, and pollutant emissions and transport that influence ozone levels across Arizona.
