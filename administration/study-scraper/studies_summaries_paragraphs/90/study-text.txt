Here is a detailed summary of the study in 1 paragraph, focusing on information and data related to ozone:

The study evaluated the effectiveness of ozone disinfection in reducing microbial loads in a broiler chicken incubation plant. Prior to ozone treatment, total aerobic mesophiles, total coliforms, E. coli, and fungi were detected at levels of 339 UFC, 3 UFC, 0 UFC, and 306 UFC, respectively. After 30 minutes of ozone exposure, microbial loads significantly decreased: total aerobic mesophiles reduced by 65% to 117 UFC at 24 hours and 272 UFC at 48 hours; coliforms and E. coli became undetectable (0 UFC); and fungi decreased by 96% to 11 UFC at 24 hours and 31 UFC at 48 hours. Statistical analysis using the T-test demonstrated significant differences between pre- and post-ozone treatment samples, indicating that ozone disinfection effectively reduced microbial loads in the incubation plant.
