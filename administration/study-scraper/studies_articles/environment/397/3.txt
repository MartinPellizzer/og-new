The study also found that RH played a crucial role in O3 pollution. Average O3-8h concentration primarily exceeded the standard value when RH varied between 45% and 65%. The inflection point for the correlation curve between O3-8h concentration and RH appeared at approximately 55%. Wind speed (WS) also influenced O3 pollution, with O3-8h concentrations increasing rapidly at WSs below 1.5 m/s, faster rates at WSs between 1.5 and 2 m/s, and decreasing slowly at WSs above 2 m/s. Dominant wind directions in Xiangtan were found to have a significant impact on O3 pollution.
