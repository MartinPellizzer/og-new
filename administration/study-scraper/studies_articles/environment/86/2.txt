The results showed that while precipitation is weakly correlated with all pollutants, a strong positive correlation between O3 and temperature was observed for all regions. A strong negative correlation was found between wind speed and NO2. However, many outliers were observed for PM2.5 concentrations in San Francisco, possibly the result of wildfire burning in California during the fall months. Additionally, a relatively strong positive correlation with NO2 was found for San Francisco using VMT data from 2020.
