The authors used a combination of field measurements and modeling simulations to derive global soil HONO emissions from natural and fertilized lands. Soil water content, temperature, and nitrogen content were taken into account as key factors controlling HONO production. The model was validated using observational data and then applied to estimate the changes in global soil HONO emissions over the past four decades.
