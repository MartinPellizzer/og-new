ABSTRACT
Climate change on earth has been an ever-present and ever-evolving process. Industrial revolution expediated climate change due to increased emission of greenhouse gases (Blanco et al., 2014). Climate change has altered ecosystems worldwide and the effects are far-reaching. Global warming will propel alterations in both biotic and abiotic components of the ecosystem. This includes weakened soil health and ecosystem services such as pollination as well as increased disease pressure, which will in turn undermine food productivity in many regions on land and in the ocean (IPCC, 2022). Warming stemming from increased anthropogenic activity has impeded the growth of agricultural productivity over the last five decades (Portner et al., 2022). Crop yields have been negatively impacted by methane emissions and increased surface ozone concentrations.
