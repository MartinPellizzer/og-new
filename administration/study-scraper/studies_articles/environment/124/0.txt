The relationship between ambient ozone exposure and insulin resistance (IR) is a growing concern in modern society. Ozone exposure has been shown to be positively associated with IR, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Telomere shortening, a hallmark of cellular senescence, has also been linked to IR. This study aims to investigate the role of telomere shortening in ambient ozone exposure-related IR.
