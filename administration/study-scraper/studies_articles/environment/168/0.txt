The IASI satellite mission has been continuously observing the Earth's atmosphere since 2007, providing a remarkable dataset of ozone trends and exceptional events. The mission's impressive radiance dataset allows for temperature, ozone, and nitric acid profiles to be retrieved both day and night, from pole to pole. This unique dataset enables researchers to monitor the ozone hole, analyze sudden stratospheric warmings, and study tropospheric increases in ozone associated with fires or local pollution events.
