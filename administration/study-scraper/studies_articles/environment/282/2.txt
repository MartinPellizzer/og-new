The results showed that the complex industrial and port activities were major causal factors of air pollution risk, followed by hydrogen sulfide, benzene, sulfur dioxide, and PM10. These factors contributed to increased levels of carbon monoxide, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and PM2.5 in the atmosphere. The effects of these factors also impacted hospitals, elderly residences, schools, industrial storage facilities, roads, urban centers, natural zones, agriculture, and waterways.
