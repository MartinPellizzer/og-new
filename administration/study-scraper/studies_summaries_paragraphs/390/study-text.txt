Here is a detailed summary of the study in 60-80 words:

A meta-analysis of 31 studies on herbaceous plants found that elevated ozone (O3) concentrations significantly impacted antioxidant oxidase activity. SOD activity increased by 34.6% to 26.3% after exposure to O3 for 1-12 days, but decreased by 12.1% after 60+ days. POD activity increased by 30.4% to 5.81%. Rice was found to be more resistant to O3 than wheat and ornamental herbs due to higher antioxidant component activity. The duration of O3 stress had a greater impact on SOD activity than plant species or O3 concentration, while plant species was the most important factor for POD activity.
