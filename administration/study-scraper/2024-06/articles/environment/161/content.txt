Here are five detailed paragraphs summarizing the study:

**Paragraph 1**
Air pollution is a major concern globally, and Iran is no exception. The city of Tehran, in particular, struggles with severe air pollution issues, posing significant threats to human health and the environment. To combat this problem, high-resolution monitoring of air pollutants is essential. However, traditional ground-based measurement stations have limitations, such as point measurements and temporal and spatial restrictions. Satellite data offers an alternative solution, but its accuracy may be limited. This study aims to develop a model that combines ground and satellite data to provide accurate and high-resolution concentration distribution maps for nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O3) pollutants in Tehran.

**Paragraph 2**
To achieve this goal, the researchers employed an innovative method based on kriging interpolation, which utilizes both ground-based measurement station data and Sentinel-5P satellite data. The study used data from 21 active air pollution measurement stations in Tehran, as well as high-resolution Sentinel-5P satellite data. Google Earth Engine was used to generate concentration distribution maps for the two pollutants in all 22 districts of Tehran on a monthly basis. Additionally, point satellite data were generated for the ground stations on an hourly, daily, and monthly basis.

**Paragraph 3**
The results show that the proposed model performed well in modeling the concentration distribution of NO2 and O3 pollutants throughout the year with high accuracy and spatial resolution (approximately one kilometer). The average monthly error decreased from 16.8% to 1.73% for NO2 pollutant and from 21.9% to 2.53% for O3 pollutant compared to Sentinel-5P satellite data. Moreover, the root mean square error (RMSE) of the model was found to be 2.79 ppb and 0.86 ppb for NO2 and O3 pollutants, respectively.

**Paragraph 4**
The study's findings demonstrate the potential benefits of combining ground-based measurement stations with Sentinel-5P satellite data for air pollution monitoring. The proposed model offers a more accurate and spatially detailed representation of air pollutant concentrations compared to traditional methods. This approach can be used for air quality management, decision-making, and policy development.

**Paragraph 5**
In conclusion, the study's results suggest that integrating ground-based measurement stations with Sentinel-5P satellite data using kriging interpolation is a valuable method for modeling the concentration distribution of NO2 and O3 pollutants in urban areas like Tehran. The proposed model offers high accuracy and spatial resolution, making it a useful tool for air pollution management and mitigation strategies. Further studies can build upon this research to explore its applications in other urban environments.
