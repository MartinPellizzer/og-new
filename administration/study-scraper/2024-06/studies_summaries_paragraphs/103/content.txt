Here is a detailed summary of the study in 1 paragraph:

A retrieval scheme was established to obtain middle and upper stratospheric ozone profiles from SCIAMACHY limb-scattered solar radiance. The study used short UV wavelengths (302-322 nm) and a long wavelength (331 nm) for wavelength pairing, simplifying the retrieval algorithm. The weighted multiplicative algebraic reconstruction technique (WMART) was employed, combined with a radiative transfer model (SCIATRAN), producing stable results. Retrieval error estimates were provided, showing a total error of typically less than 18% in the altitude range of 30-53 km. The retrieved ozone profiles agreed with SCIAMACHY v3.5 data within -10% to 5%, except at 45 km where the bias became larger (-15%). Comparisons with OSIRIS v7.1 and ACE-FTS v4.0 data showed differences of Â±10% or less for 30-53 km altitude, with errors mostly less than -5% below 43 km compared to ACE-FTS v4.0.
