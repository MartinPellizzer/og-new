The experimental methods involved preparing zinc sulfite by reacting pure or industrial zinc oxide with SO2 in water. The oxidation experiments were conducted under constant temperature conditions, with slurry, oxygen, and ozone concentrations in the ranges of 0.5-4%, 10-60%, and 1100-1920 ppm, respectively. The experiments involved determining the zinc ion concentration, sulfite concentration, dissolved oxygen, ozone concentration in the exhaust gas, and total organic carbon (TOC) value for analysis of the oxidation process.
