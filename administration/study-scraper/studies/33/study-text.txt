Abstract

Objective
 :
"
Prior to any restorative therapy, it is crucial to disinfect the dentin surface to

ensure the treatment's durability.. This research was done to find out how different dentin

cleaning techniques affected the shear bond strength (SBS) of resin
-
modified glas
s inomer

cement both immediately and afterwards (RMGIC)..

Material and Methods:
 "
A smooth dentinal surface was obtained by trimming the

occlusal surfaces of 60 extracted premolars, which were then randomly divided into three

groups. 2% CHX gluconate in gro
up II, ozonated water in group III, and group I distilled

water (control). Subgroups 1 and 2 of each group were then examined for shear bond

strength after 24 hours and three months, respectively (n = 10).

Results:
 For 24 hr, the shear bond strength was hi
gher in DW followed by Ozone while it

was the lowest in CHX with significant difference while for 3 months, the shear bond

strength was higher in CHX followed by Ozone while it was the lowest in DW with

significant difference.

Conclusions:
 According to th
e study's findings, it is advised to employ ozone as a

disinfection agent to prolong the life of the GIC restoration and prevent bond strength

deterioration.

Introduction

Minimally
 invasive
 dentistry
 involves
 cavity

preparation
 limited
 to
 the
 removal
 of
 carious

dentin. This is, however, difficult to achieve in

pediatric practice owing to the lack of a definite

diagnostic
 tool
 to
 clinically
 define
 the

caries-removal endpoint, difficult compliance from

an
 uncooperative
 child,
 and
 lack
 of
 an
 ideal

anticariogenic
 restorative
 material
 effective
 in

controlling
 growth and the activity
 of
 residual

microorganisms.[1]
 These
 problems
 can
 be

overcome
 by
 either
 incorporating
 antibacterial

agents into the restorative materials which may,

however, decline the physical properties of the

restorative material to unacceptable levels or the

other
 alternative
 of
 using
 cavity
 disinfectant

solutions in order to lower or get rid of germs from

cavity preparations.

Chlorhexidine (CHX) has been found to be, "the

most
 potent
 antimicrobial
 agent
 in
 addition
 to

having
 a
 potential
 to
 reduce the
 postoperative

sensitivity]However" its use may interfere with

adhesive procedures
 to
 dentin.
 Although
 many

studies have described the effect of CHX on bond

strength
 of
 composite restoration
 its
 early and

delay
 effect
 on
 resin
 modified
 glass
 inomer

restorative cement is still unclear".[2]

"Ozone, a triatomic molecule with three oxygen

atoms, is a potent oxidizing agent that has been,

used in dental procedures, due to its ability, to

fight common oral diseases with antimicrobials.

Clinical studies assessed Ozone's effectiveness in

treating
 occlusal
 and
 root
 caries,
 and
 more

recently, the use of ozone to treat dental hard

tissues as a cavity disinfectant before adhesive

restorations has been proposed. Ozone's impact on

the
 bonding
 strenght
 of
 resin-modified
 glass-

inomer restorative cement is still unknown".

It is preferred to employ a cavity disinfectant that

maintains
 the physical properties
 of
 restorative

material,
 therefore the purpose of this in vitro

study was to compare early and delayed impact of

various cavity disinfectants
 on the strength of a

shear
 bond
 of
 resin
 modified
 glass
 inomer

restorative cement.[3]

Material and Method

The sample

"Sixty healthy human maxillary first premolars,

ranging in age from 16 to 24, of both sexes were

extracted for orthodontic treatment. The teeth were

of equal size and form were selected and collected

from different health centers in Iraq to be prepared

for this study. To reduce confounding factors" the

teeth were chosen if they appeared sound (free

from cracks and caries), employing a fiber optic

light curing device and under trans illumination"

while being magnified (10X), and if their crown

sizes
 were
 roughly
 comparable
 "Cracked
 or

carious, the sample was not including these teeth.
