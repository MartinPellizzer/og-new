Stability requirements of satellites to detect long-term stratospheric ozone trends based upon Monte Carlo simulations
Mark Weber
Abstract
For new satellite instruments, specifications of the stability required for climate variables are provided in order to be useful for certain applications – for instance, deriving long-term trends. The stability is usually stated in units of percent per decade (% per decade) and is often associated with or termed instrument drift. A stability requirement of 3 % per decade or better has been recently stated for tropospheric and stratospheric ozone. However, the way this number is derived is not clear. In this study, we use Monte Carlo simulations to investigate how a stability requirement translates into uncertainties in long-term trends depending on the lifetime of individual observing systems, which are merged into time series, and the period of available observations. Depending on the need to observe a certain trend over a given period, e.g., typically +1 % per decade for total ozone and +2 % per decade for stratospheric ozone over 30 years, stability for observation systems can be properly specified and justified in order to achieve statistical significance in the observed long-term trend. Assuming a typical mean lifetime of 7 years for an individual observing system and a stability of 3 % per decade results in a 2 % per decade trend uncertainty over a period of 30 years, which is barely sufficient for stratospheric ozone but too high for total ozone. Having two or three observing systems simultaneously reduces the uncertainty by 30 % and 42 %, respectively. Such redundancies may be more efficient than developing satellite instruments with higher long-term stability to reduce long-term trend uncertainties. The method presented here is applicable to any variable of interest for which long-term changes are to be detected.

1 Introduction
Of the ozone in the overhead (total) column, 90 % resides in the stratosphere and protects the Earth system from harmful UV radiation (Zerefos et al., 2023). The phaseout of ozone-depleting substances (ODS), according to the Montreal Protocol and its amendments, leads to recovery of stratospheric ozone in some regions of the atmosphere after the late 1990s (Hassler et al., 2022). Statistically significant trends are observed in the upper stratosphere, with an increase of up to about +2 % per decade (Godin-Beekmann et al., 2022). In the extratropics, total column ozone has increased by a rate of up to about +1 % per decade (Coldewey-Egbers et al., 2022; Weber et al., 2022). The reported statistical trend uncertainty at the 2σ level for ozone profiles is typically of the same order as the trend itself at about 1 %–2 % per decade, and similarly for total column ozone at about 0.5 %–1 % per decade (SPARC/IO3C/GAW, 2019; Godin-Beekmann et al., 2022; Weber et al., 2018, 2022).
Uncertainties in ozone trends reported recently (e.g., Hassler et al., 2022; Godin-Beekmann et al., 2022; Weber et al., 2022) are determined from the statistics of trend regression alone. Bourassa et al. (2014) reported added uncertainties due to drifts of the OSIRIS satellite to the statistical uncertainty, here at 3 % per decade, which reduced the atmospheric region (altitude and latitude) of the atmosphere showing significant positive trends. A direct comparison between various merged ozone profiles shows that the drifts in the difference between zonal mean single-instrument datasets are on the order of 3 % per decade (2σ) but not always statistically significant (Rahpoe et al., 2015; Hubert et al., 2016). Similarly, the spread in the recent total ozone trends from the available merged datasets is on the order of ±0.5 % per decade (2σ). The apparent drifts are not only due to changes in the instrument performance, but can also be dependent on how the individual datasets are merged into the long-term dataset (Frith et al., 2017; Weber et al., 2022). Since multiple time series are available, the statistical trend uncertainty can be further reduced by averaging trends or calculating trends from the median or mean of datasets (e.g., Steinbrecht et al., 2017; SPARC/IO3C/GAW, 2019; Godin-Beekmann et al., 2022; Weber et al., 2022).
Ozone is expected to recover from the decrease in ozone-depleting substances, but long-term changes also depend on the evolution of greenhouse gases (GHGs) as well as on the feedback mechanism between ozone and climate (Hassler et al., 2022). The Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer (United Nations, 1985), which set, among others, the framework for the Montreal Protocol signed in 1987, also stated the need for continuing the observation of ozone, related species, and climate gases. For long-term observations of ozone and other trace species, specific requirements of accuracy and stability for observing systems were defined and updated over the years (e.g., World Meteorological Organisation, 2001, 2004, 2011; CCI, 2021; CMUG, 2022; World Meteorological Organisation, 2022). For trend detection, a stability requirement of 3 % per decade was initially stated for stratospheric ozone and 1 % per decade for total ozone (World Meteorological Organisation, 2001). Main application areas defined were trends and operational meteorology for stratospheric ozone (World Meteorological Organisation, 2001). The 3 % per decade value is also currently defined as the threshold value for stratospheric profiles and total column of ozone, meaning that a satellite instrument will only be useful if this threshold is not exceeded (CCI, 2021; World Meteorological Organisation, 2022; CMUG, 2022). In addition to the threshold value, a breakthrough (2 % per decade) and target value (1 % per decade) are provided (World Meteorological Organisation, 2022). No specification in these documents is given regarding if the stability requirement is stated as one (1σ) or 2 standard deviations (2σ). With regard to the observed long-term ozone trends, these values only make sense if they are defined as 2σ (2 standard deviations).
It is not clear how these specifications are derived, but they are very likely derived from the observed statistical ozone trend uncertainties and the expectation that the requirements should be close but lower than these uncertainties. The question we raise here in the paper is how such a requirement can be justified by the need to achieve a certain trend uncertainty over a given period of time. From the ozone recovery perspective, the time range since ODS peaked in the stratosphere is close to 30 years. A similar but different question was addressed by Weatherhead et al. (1998). Based upon the noise of data and serial correlation, they determined, on statistical grounds, how many years we need to observe a significant trend, which occurs when twice the trend uncertainty is lower than the trend magnitude (2σ significance).
We use Monte Carlo simulations to investigate how a stability requirement translates into uncertainties in long-term trends depending on the lifetime of individual satellite instruments, which are merged into long-term time series, and the overall period of available observations. In Sect. 2, the scheme of the Monte Carlo simulation is described. Results are presented in Sect. 3 and discussed in Sect. 4. We close with concluding remarks in Sect. 5.
2 Monte Carlo simulations
The scheme of Monte Carlo simulations of time series and derived trend uncertainties due to a given stability requirement are shown in Fig. 1 (e.g., Guimaräes Couto et al., 2013). We assume that a simulated time series is zero without any drift and bias after the subtraction of the start value. Each individual observing system with a given lifetime (segment) of which we compose a long-term merged dataset (time series) has varying drifts in % per decade, which follow a Gaussian distribution with a given 1σ stability requirement (e.g., 1.5 % per decade, as shown in Fig. 1a). The variability seen in the sample of 1 million long-term time series (Fig. 1b) is therefore solely due to the instrument drifts following the stability distribution. As an example, four single time series over 30 years are shown in red. Each segment is 7 years long, corresponding to a constant lifetime. For simplicity, an overlap period is not considered here (Weatherhead et al., 2017).

For each of the time series, a simple linear trend was fit and the distribution of trends, and its width representing the trend uncertainty given by the standard deviation of the distribution is shown in Fig. 1c. Here, the trends are calculated for a 30-year period. A stability requirement of 1.5 % per decade (1σ) and a lifetime of 7 years for each observing system result in a trend uncertainty of 0.77 % per decade after 30 years (close to half the value of the stability requirement). With a required limit of stability of 3 % per decade (2σ) for ozone, trends lower than about 1.5 % per decade (2σ) are not detectable after 30 years (simply doubling the numbers given in the previous sentence).
Some additional modifications in the simulation were introduced. In a merged dataset, the individual observing systems have varying lifetimes. An expected lifetime of 7 years is typical of current satellite systems, e.g., TROPOMI (Veefkind et al., 2012). Several satellite instruments measured for a decade or more (e.g., SAGE II for 21 years; OSIRIS for more than 20 years; OMI for 19 years; GOME-2A for 12 years; and SCIAMACHY, MIPAS, and GOMOS for 10 years). In a different setup, we therefore vary the lifetimes of individual segments following a Poisson distribution with a mean of 7 years (Fig. 2). Later, we also show results for instruments with a longer mean lifetime of 12 years, When merging datasets, usually segments of a single observation system with some extended records are used. In our case, we set a lower limit of 5 years to be included in the time series.

Additional uncertainties come from biases between individuals segments. Biases can be corrected when sufficient overlap exists between observing systems, as discussed in detail in Weatherhead et al. (2017). In our simulations, we do not consider any overlap periods, but we allow for a Gaussian distributed bias from one segment to the other. Figure 3 shows the samples of time series assuming 0 %, 1 %, and 2 % bias (1σ), respectively. In both simulations, varying lifetimes with a mean of 7 years and Poisson distribution (Fig. 2) were assumed.

With a stability requirement of 1.5 % per decade, the trend uncertainty after 30 years slightly increases from 0.77 % to 0.83 % per decade using varying lifetimes instead of a constant lifetime of 7 years (Figs. 2b and 3a). A larger change in uncertainties is seen by adding a 1 % bias between segments, resulting in an increase to 1.1 % per decade. This means that, for ozone observed with
