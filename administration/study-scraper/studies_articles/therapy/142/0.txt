The present systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate the effect of ozone therapy on diabetes-related foot ulcer (DFU) outcomes. DFUs are a common complication of diabetes mellitus, causing significant morbidity, mortality, and economic burden. The development of effective treatments for DFUs is crucial to improve patient quality of life and reduce healthcare costs. Ozone therapy has been proposed as an adjunct treatment for DFUs, but the available evidence remains inconsistent and inconclusive.
