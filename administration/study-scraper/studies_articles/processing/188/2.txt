The results of the study showed that three Fusarium strains, N1, N2, and N3, were identified in the wheat samples. Strains N1 and N3 belonged to Fusarium graminearum and Fusarium culmatum, respectively, while strain N2 was identified as Fusarium asiaticum. The toxin-producing gene detection and mycotoxin detection revealed that strains N1 and N3 could produce zearalenone and vomitoxin, but not fumonisin, whereas strain N2 did not produce these three toxins. Further analysis of the spore morphology, mycelium length, and mycelium morphology after gas fumigation showed that chlorine dioxide effectively inhibited the growth of mycelium and spore germination, while ozone only inhibited spore germination.
