In conclusion, this study provides evidence that ozonated Aloe vera oil can accelerate wound healing in radiation dermatitis. The findings have significant implications for the management of this common side effect of radiation therapy, particularly for patients who require long-term treatment. Further research is needed to confirm these results and to explore the potential use of ozonated Aloe vera oil as a novel therapeutic agent for wound healing.
