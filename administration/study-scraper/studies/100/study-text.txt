The quality of the urban environment in tropical and subtropical densely

populated cities is a complicated subject that has garnered a lot of attention in

the current setting. Some of the most polluted cities in Rajasthan are Bhiwadi,

Jaipur, Kota, and Uda
ipur, where the air quality has drastically declined over the

previous ten years, according to an IQAir report. In order to determine the

seasonal and temporal fluctuations in the concentrations of major air pollutants,

such as carbon monoxide (CO), ozone
 (O
3
), nitrogen dioxide (NO
2
), sulphur

dioxide (SO
2
), and particulate matter (PM10
 and PM2.5
), in an urban setting in

Rajasthan, this study will examine the ambient air quality in severely polluted

cities throughout the state. A comprehensive investigation of the seasonal and

temporal variations in ambient air quality throughout Rajasthan's extremely

polluted cities was m
ade possible by the application of PCA and the K

 We
 interpreted
 the
 intricate
 patterns
 of
 pollution

oscillations by means of rigorous time
-
series analysis, providing insight into the

dynamic interactions among meteorological con
ditions, sources of pollution, and

regulatory actions.
 The results indicate that there were more seasonal variations

during the summer, and that levels of particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) and

nitrogen dioxide (NO
2
) in places like Jaipur, Bhiwadi, Kota, and Udaipur

alarmingly rose above pre
-
pandemic levels. This highlights the significance of

identifying and addressing the various challenges caused by air pollution at

different times of the year and in different sea
sons. Furthermore, identifying the

main sources of pollution and assessing the effectiveness of current legislation

offer insightful information for focused actions.
