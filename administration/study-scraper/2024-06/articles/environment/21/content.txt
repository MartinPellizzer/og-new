Here are the five detailed paragraphs based on the scientific study:

**Paragraph 1**
Germicidal ultraviolet lamps emitting 222 nm light (GUV222) have gained attention for their potential to reduce the airborne spread of disease by effectively inactivating pathogens while being safe for direct human exposure. However, recent studies have identified these lamps as a source of ozone and other secondary pollutants, such as secondary organic aerosol (SOA), which poses a threat to human health. To better understand the impact of GUV222 on SOA formation and composition, researchers conducted a laboratory study comparing limonene oxidation under GUV222 and O3-only control conditions.

**Paragraph 2**
The researchers used a laboratory chamber to investigate the impacts of GUV222 light on SOA formation and composition by comparing limonene oxidation under GUV222 and O3-only control conditions. The experiments involved exposing limonene, a common organic compound found in outdoor air, to GUV222 light or ozone only, and then analyzing the resulting SOA particles. To further examine the effects of NO2 and nitrous acid (HONO) on SOA formation, additional experiments were conducted with these additives.

**Paragraph 3**
The results showed that SOA composition and yield varied slightly between GUV222 and O3-only conditions. However, when high-fluence 222 nm light was used, consistent new particle formation occurred, which differed dramatically from ozone-only experiments. These findings suggest that non-ozone chemical processes initiated by GUV222 light play a significant role in SOA formation.

**Paragraph 4**
The observed new particle formation under high-fluence 222 nm light is an important finding, as it highlights the need to keep GUV222 fluence rates at the lowest effective levels. The study also suggests that ozone chemistry is responsible for much of the secondary indoor air pollution associated with GUV222 lamps. Future research should focus on understanding the mechanisms underlying non-ozone chemical processes initiated by GUV222 light and their impact on SOA formation.

**Paragraph 5**
In conclusion, this study demonstrates the importance of considering both ozone-initiated and non-ozone pathways in understanding the impacts of GUV222 light on SOA formation. The findings highlight the need for careful control of GUV222 fluence rates to minimize secondary pollution and ensure safe use of these lamps. Further research is necessary to fully comprehend the effects of GUV222 light on indoor air quality and human health.
