Here is a summary of the study in one paragraph, focusing on the information related to ozone:

This study investigated the relationship between surface ozone pollution and meteorological conditions in determining episode periods for Jakarta, Indonesia. The analysis revealed that ozone concentrations increased during dry months (May to October) with the highest hourly value recorded at 263 μg/m³. Significant episodes of ozone pollution were identified on six days between May and October 2023. Daily, monthly, and seasonal ozone variations aligned with meteorological conditions, showing higher concentrations during dry months. The study suggests that understanding NOx or VOC emission sensitivities is crucial for effective ozone abatement strategies in Jakarta.
