The FTIR spectra revealed new peaks corresponding to C=O and O-H functional groups after the reaction. The intensity of these peaks increased with reaction time, indicating the formation of products containing these functional groups. The IR spectrum of the brown precipitate obtained at the end of the reaction showed distinct new peaks at 893 cm-1, 1636 cm-1, 1727 cm-1, and 3212 cm-1, which correspond to bending vibration mode of C=C-H, stretching vibration mode of C=C, C=O stretching vibration mode, and O-H stretching mode, respectively. These results suggest that the reaction between 1,2-dichlorobenzene and ozone leads to the formation of products containing these functional groups.
