The study's results have significant implications for the development of a commercial duckweed industry. The optimal abiotic parameters and management protocols established in this study provide a foundation for large-scale cultivation of duckweed. Additionally, the finding that aqueous ozonation can effectively reduce total bacterial load highlights the potential benefits of using this technology in CEA systems. Future studies should investigate the long-term effects of aquaculture on microbial communities and explore the integration of duckweed production with other crops in vertical farming systems.
