Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the study, focusing on information related to ozone:

The UV/Ozone accelerated aging technique was used to create artificial deteriorated standard dyed woolen samples for textile conservation purposes. The method involved exposing dyed wool samples to UV light and ozone for varying durations, causing the colors to fade and the morphology to change. The study found that yellow dyes were most light-sensitive, while red dyes aged faster. The results showed a significant decrease in tensile strength and elongation of the wool fibers with increased aging time, and changes in CIE L*a*b* parameters and overall color difference (Î”E*) were analyzed. The technique was found to be efficient in simulating the degradation of historical textiles, providing valuable insights for conservation research.
