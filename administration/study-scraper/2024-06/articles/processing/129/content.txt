Here are five detailed paragraphs based on the provided scientific study:

**Paragraph 1**
The efficient removal of antibiotics from pharmaceutical wastewater is a pressing concern due to their potential harm to human health and the environment. Ozonation and photocatalysis have been widely used for wastewater treatment, but they have limitations in terms of efficiency and cost-effectiveness. This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of a combined photocatalytic ozonation-electroflucculation process using modified bentonite/UV/TiO2/ZnO (CBOEF) for antibiotic removal from real pharmaceutical wastewater.

**Paragraph 2**
The experiments were conducted in a modified hybrid batch reactor with UV-C lamp, and four operational variables were investigated: applied voltage of 5-15 V, ozone dose of 0.2-0.8 mg/min, pH of 5-10, and catalyst dose of 0.5-1.5 g/L. The effects of these variables on turbidity and COD removal were evaluated, and the removal efficiencies of antibiotics carbamazepine and amoxicillin were compared with various treatment processes.

**Paragraph 3**
The results showed that the combined photocatalytic ozonation-electroflucculation process (CBOEF) provided the highest removal efficiency for COD (86.9%) and turbidity (81.66%) under optimized conditions of applied voltage of 10 V, catalyst dose of 1 g/L, and ozone dose of 0.6 mg/min. The pharmaceuticals removal obtained for amoxicillin was 100%, while carbamazepine removal efficiency was 95%.

**Paragraph 4**
The detailed mechanism of the CBOEF process was explored to better understand each component's contribution. Ozonation reacted with organic matter, producing reactive oxygen species (ROS) that enhanced photocatalytic activity. Electroflucculation removed suspended solids and improved UV transmittance, enhancing the photodegradation reaction. The modified bentonite/UV/TiO2/ZnO photocatalyst demonstrated excellent adsorption capacity for antibiotics, facilitating their removal.

**Paragraph 5**
The combined photocatalytic ozonation-electroflucculation process (CBOEF) showed promising results in treating real pharmaceutical wastewater, achieving high removal efficiencies of COD and turbidity. This novel photocatalyst and hybrid system can be used to treat effluents on a large scale and contribute to meeting UN sustainability goals. The study's findings suggest that CBOEF is an effective and efficient treatment process for antibiotic-contaminated wastewater, warranting further investigation and implementation in industrial settings.
