Here is a summarized paragraph focusing on the information related to ozone:

The study highlights the severe air pollution crisis in South Asia, with ground level ozone and particulate matter (PM2.5) being major concerns. In Delhi, Dhaka, and Lahore, the levels of PM2.5 have increased significantly over the last decade, posing serious health risks, including increased respiratory diseases and premature death, especially among non-smokers and children. The economic costs of this pollution are also substantial, with estimates suggesting that they could reach as high as 1% of global GDP by 2060, due to healthcare use and productivity loss.
