In conclusion, this study presents a comprehensive analysis of high-resolution spectra of ozone ($^{16}$O$_{3}$) using the MARVEL method. The results demonstrate the ability to determine accurate ro-vibrational energy levels with uncertainties. The validation of these energies against effective Hamiltonian and variational nuclear motion calculations provides confidence in their accuracy and reliability. This study contributes to a better understanding of the molecular structure and behavior of ozone, which is essential for atmospheric science and related fields.
