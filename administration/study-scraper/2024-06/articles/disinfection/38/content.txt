Here are the five detailed paragraphs based on the scientific study:

**Paragraph 1**
Introduction
Waterborne pathogens pose significant threats to public health. The quorum sensing (QS) system plays a crucial role in coordinating bacterial growth and metabolism. However, the responses and regulatory mechanisms of bacteria to various disinfection technologies through QS are still unclear. This study aimed to investigate the inactivation effect of chlorination and ozonation on biofilms and planktonic cells of QS signaling-deficient mutants of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

**Paragraph 2**
Methods
In this study, we used Pseudomonas aeruginosa as the model organism to examine the inactivation effect of chlorination and ozonation on biofilms and planktonic cells. We employed a combination of cell counting and viability assessment to evaluate the disinfection efficacy. Additionally, microfluidic chip culture was used to investigate the secretion of quinolone signals by biofilms. Gene expression analysis was conducted using RNA sequencing to identify changes in gene expression patterns under different disinfection treatments.

**Paragraph 3**
Results
Our results showed that the combined disinfection of chlorine and ozone was the most effective for inactivating planktonic Pseudomonas aeruginosa within 10 minutes of exposure. Microfluidic chip culture demonstrated that the secretion of quinolone signals escalated biofilms' disinfection resistance. Disinfection exposure significantly altered the gene expression profiles of wild-type strains and QS signaling-deficient mutants, indicating a complex regulatory response to disinfectant exposure.

**Paragraph 4**
Discussion
Our study highlights the importance of considering the QS system in understanding bacterial responses to disinfection technologies. The elevated secretion of quinolone signals by biofilms may contribute to their increased resistance to disinfection. Furthermore, the changes in gene expression patterns under different disinfection treatments suggest a complex regulatory response, which may involve oxidative stress, ribosome synthesis, and nutrient absorption.

**Paragraph 5**
Conclusion
In conclusion, our study provides insights into the regulatory mechanisms of bacterial QS in response to chlorine and ozone disinfection. The findings suggest that the combination of these two disinfectants is effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms and planktonic cells. Additionally, the study highlights the importance of considering the QS system in understanding bacterial responses to disinfection technologies, which may lead to more effective disinfection strategies for controlling waterborne pathogens.
