Abstract

Nowadays, the world is dealing with major challenges such as environmental

pollution, global warming, ozone depletion, and waste accumulation. Consequently,

scholarly literature has directed its
 attention towards these concerns and has

documented that climate change is occurring at a rapid pace. Furthermore, it has

been asserted that this change will persist in the future. The transition to hydrogen

(H
2
) as a fuel source is the most viable option for reducing carbon emissions.

Consequently, in this research, an inquiry is undertaken on the life cycle assessment

(LCA) of the ammonia transportation, covering various phases such as production of

pipelines,
 reservoir tank, and pump station facility, al
ong with hydrogen production

from ammonia. The findings indicated that the predominantly impacted classification

in relation to harm evaluation is linked with the human health. Besides, the amount of

CO
2
 emission per various functional units which are considered foe each phase, are

reported.

Introduction

The utilization of fossil fuels across different sectors such as industry, transportation,

commerce, and residence has given rise to significant challenges concerning human

health. To mitigate the detrimental impacts of fossil fuels, it is imperative to

pr
ogressively implement sustainable fuels and solutions. Environmental compatibility

is considered a fundamental characteristic of sustainable sources. The feasibility of

establishing a worldwide hydrogen
-
based economy is currently impractical, even

though h
ydrogen is acknowledged as a highly promising source of fuel. This is

primarily due to the absence of a viable storage medium unless one is discovered
 [1]

In addition, there is a requirement for substantial capital investments to establish a
436

hydrogen distribution system. This gives rise to complex safety concerns due to the

volatility of hydrogen and its low flash point, thus posing an explosion hazard in the

presence of air. In addition, hydrogen exhibits a significantly reduced volumetric

en
ergy density in comparison to conventional fuels employed in transportation

vehicles. However, the transport of hydrogen through pipelines to these industries

presents challenges. For example, the low energy density of hydrogen necessitates

the use of sign
ificantly high flow rates to meet the energy demands of end
-
users.

Therefore, there is a need for alternative methods of transporting hydrogen, such as

hydrogen "carriers". Interestingly, ammonia presents a more cost
-
effective option for

energy storage, as
 its cost per unit volume of stored energy is three times cheaper

than that of hydrogen
 [2]
. Ammonia promises due to its high hydrogen storage

capacity (17.65 wt.%H
2
), the ability to transport and store it in liquid phase under

moderate conditions (10bar
 and 25
℃
), over 5 decades of industrial experience in its

use, and the relative ease of extracting hydrogen by "cracking" ammonia. Besides,

ammonia possesses similar characteristics to hydrogen in that it can serve as a

clean energy carrier and storage medium. Thi
s is due to its potential for

environmentally friendly combustion, resulting in the emission of only water and

nitrogen. Storage of ammonia follows a similar process to propane, with a vapor

pressure of 8 bar at room temperature

.

LCA quantifies the environmental consequences linked to the complete life cycle of a

product, process, or service. Each stage of
 a product's life cycle, from raw material

extraction to production, use, and disposal, can have various environmental impacts.

These stages are referred to as life cycle stages. LCA allows for the assessment of

the environmental impacts of a product or ser
vice throughout its entire life cycle or at

any specific stage in between
 [4]
.

Various studies in the literature have delved into the LCA related to hydrogen

production. For instance, Momirlan and Veziroglu
 [5]
 conducted an analysis on the

current state of hydrogen energy and different methods of hydrogen production,

focusing on as
pects such as economics, environmental implications, applications,

and the global status of hydrogen energy. Koroneos et al.
 [6]
 carried out an LCA to

assess the environmental impact of different hydrogen production techniques, with
