Here are the five detailed paragraphs based on the study:

**Paragraph 1**
A study was conducted to investigate the detoxification of cyanide tailings slurry generated in the all-sliming cyanidation CIP process at Guilaizhuang Gold Mine using ozone. The aim of the study was to develop an effective and economical method for removing cyanides from the leachate of filter-press cake, which is a crucial step in gold mining. The use of ozone as a detoxification agent has gained popularity due to its high oxidation efficiency and low environmental impact.

**Paragraph 2**
The experimental design involved the addition of ozone to the cyanide tailings slurry under controlled conditions. The pH level was maintained at 11.52, and the concentration of ozone was set at 7.14 g/mÂ³. A buffer solution was also added to ensure stable oxidation reaction conditions. The experiment was conducted for a duration of 2 hours to simulate the industrial-scale detoxification process.

**Paragraph 3**
The results showed that after 2 hours of oxidation reaction, the mass concentration of total cyanide compounds in the leachate of the filter-press cake was significantly reduced to 2.13 mg/L, which meets the standards for pollution control and disposal in tailings dams. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of ozone as a detoxification agent in removing cyanides from gold mining tailings.

**Paragraph 4**
The findings of this study have significant implications for the development of an industrial-scale cyanide tailings slurry detoxification process using ozone. The results suggest that the process is not only effective but also economical, with an ore treatment cost of 6.00 yuan/t. Moreover, the absence of interfering ions in the detoxified leachate eliminates the need for additional treatment steps.

**Paragraph 5**
In conclusion, this study provides valuable insights into the use of ozone as a detoxification agent for cyanide tailings slurry generated in gold mining operations. The results demonstrate the potential of ozone to remove cyanides effectively and economically, making it an attractive alternative to traditional detoxification methods. Further research is needed to optimize the process conditions and scaling up the technology for industrial applications.
