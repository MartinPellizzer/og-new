Here are the five detailed paragraphs based on the scientific study:

**Paragraph 1**
Near-surface ozone (O3) is a harmful atmospheric pollutant that is a key component of urban photochemical pollution. The availability of satellite ozone concentration products has been predominantly restricted to daytime, resulting in a lack of understanding of nighttime O3 pollution. This research aims to address this knowledge gap by leveraging geostationary satellite data to estimate 24-hour near-surface O3 concentrations in China for 2020.

**Paragraph 2**
The method used in this study leverages 5-km bright temperatures derived from Advanced Himawari Images (AHI) on the Himawari-8 satellite, along with auxiliary data, to estimate 24-hour near-surface O3 concentrations. The model achieved an average 5-fold cross-validation R2 of 0.92. Comparative analysis with on-site observations revealed that the model had low relative errors between 8:00 and 21:00 LT.

**Paragraph 3**
The estimated O3 maps depicted a consistent 24-hour variation pattern, characterized by high and fluctuating concentrations during the daytime, reaching a peak around 16:00 LT. This is primarily due to increased photochemical reactions and O3 accumulation in the mid-afternoon. The study found that high surface ozone concentrations were mainly contributed by June in the daytime of summer.

**Paragraph 4**
The results also showed that elevated levels of O3 were predominantly found in central China, particularly in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region and Inner Mongolia. Although the highest average daytime surface O3 concentration occurred in summer, the highest nighttime concentration was observed in spring, which may be attributed to frequent horizontal transport and vertical mixing of O3.

**Paragraph 5**
This study holds promise in providing comprehensive round-the-clock surface O3 data across China, thereby enhancing our understanding of diurnal ground-level O3 variations. The model's ability to accurately estimate O3 concentrations has significant implications for air quality management and pollution control strategies in China. Future studies can build upon this research by incorporating additional data sources and improving the model's performance to provide even more accurate predictions.
