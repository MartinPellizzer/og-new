Abstract
In the context of escalating urban heat dynamics, the effect of air pollutants on Land Surface Temperature (LST) is an urgent concern, especially in the Global South. These regions are experiencing rapid industrialization, leading to an increase in greenhouse gas concentrations. Although the heat-absorbing capacity of air pollutants is well-recognized, the spatiotemporal relationship between these pollutants and LST remains underexplored, particularly in densely populated and industrialized metropolitan areas. Moreover, studies examining multiple pollutants simultaneously to understand their cumulative impact on surface temperature anomalies are scarce. Our study addresses this research gap by developing a spatial–temporal framework using remote sensing data from Google Earth Engine (GEE). We assessed the levels of Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), Carbon Monoxide (CO), Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), Ozone (O3), Sulfur Dioxide (SO2), and Formaldehyde (HCHO) in Bangladesh. Utilizing Emerging Hotspot Analysis and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) and complementing these with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to create a Pollutant Impact Index (PII), we provide a detailed understanding of pollutant's impact on LST. The results revealed a global R-squared value of 0.61 with maximum local R-squared value of 0.68. Over 30% of the areas studied exhibit high-high clusters for air pollutant coefficients, with notably alarming levels of NO2 and O3, affecting 48.53% and 54.67% of the area, respectively. The PCA underscored the significant role of these pollutants, with the first three principal components accounting for 75% of the variance. Notably, the spatial distribution of the PII across Bangladesh showed substantial regional variations. Urban areas, like Dhaka and Sylhet, exhibited much higher PII values compared to less industrialized regions. These insights highlight the need for targeted environmental strategies to mitigate the impact of air pollution on urban heat dynamics and public health. The study’s findings underscore the urgency of addressing these environmental challenges, particularly in rapidly developing areas of the Global South.

1 Introduction
The implementation of stricter pollution emission regulations by local governments and international organizations has resulted in a general decrease in pollutant concentrations worldwide (Baldasano et al. 2003). For example, recent global air quality studies conducted over the past decade reveal that noxious pollutants levels have been on the decline across most regions of the world (Venter et al. 2020). However, this decline does not hold true for all pollutants nor for all areas of the world (Lelieveld et al. 2015; Van Donkelaar et al. 2015). Concentrations of NO2 are routinely found to be at or near the safety threshold guidelines established by the World Health Organization (WHO) (WHO 2018). Particulate matter has also emerged as a critical environmental issue in Asia, with some areas experiencing concentrations in excess of 300 g/m3 (Gupta & Christopher 2009), far above the safety threshold. Furthermore, Ozone levels have consistently exceeded established guideline limits for many regions of the world, indicating that it remains a global problem of significant concern (EPA 2021; UNEP/WMO, 2011). Other studies have suggested that despite advancements in some regions (i.e. the Global North), developing nations and those with low average incomes (Global South) continue to experience comparatively high levels of air pollution (Brauer et al. 2016; Chowdhury et al. 2019; Shaddick et al. 2018). Moreover, as Global South countries continue to grow, there is a tendency for air pollution levels to increase further, thereby exacerbating the already dire situation (Baldasano et al. 2003; Mage et al. 1996). In fact, the Global South now accounts for roughly 80% of the world's population and has been marked by extensive urbanization, industrialization, and rampant deforestation (Bologna and Aquino 2020; Patinvoh and Taherzadeh 2019; United Nations 2019) which is associated with further degradation in air quality.
In addition to respiratory and other health related issues associated with a decline in air quality (Domingo and Rovira 2020), there are other important implications related to the ambient environment. Specifically, increases in air pollution are associated with an increase in LST (Cao et al. 2016). Research indicates that urban aerosols or haze is one of the leading factors for this increase because it can substantially exacerbate the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect. Haze contributes to an increase in nighttime surface temperature UHI by approximately 0.7 ± 0.3˚C (mean ± 1 standard error). Notably, this effect varies spatially and tends to intensify with seasonal changes in humidity and the associated AOD (Cao et al. 2016). The utilization of remote sensing data is particularly advantageous when it comes to monitoring AOD. For instance, Biswas et al. (2017) utilized remote sensing to reveal that the highest AOD concentrations in India are observed during the pre-monsoon season (March–May) that gradually diminishes in the post-monsoon period (October–November). Others have used remote sensing to evaluate a more explicit connection between the AOD and LST (He 2022; Islam et al. 2022; Z. Liu et al. 2020; Perone 2022; Wu et al. 2022).
Increases in LST contribute to the UHI effect. The UHI effect is marked by elevated temperatures in metropolitan regions when contrasted with their rural counterparts. Given the relationship between air pollution and LST, the UHI effect can be partly attributed to the assimilation and preservation of heat by pollutants, including nitrogen oxides and particulate matter (Akbari et al. 2001; Kafy et al. 2022; Z. A. Rahaman et al. 2022a, b; Ruan et al. 2021), which work to alter the reflectance of the earth's surface and lead to changes in temperature (Bond et al. 2013). Moreover, studies have established that air pollution can exert a substantial influence on vegetation health which is an important urban heat regulator (Park et al. 2021). For example, Kumari et al. (2021) and others (Rahaman et al. 2023; Tian et al. 2020) have found that elevated levels of pollutants, such as ozone and sulfur dioxide, can harm vegetation and lead to fluctuations in surface temperatures.
The interplay between LST and air pollutants' concentration, pivotal for urban and environmental planning, can be discerned through the lens of remote sensing data and statistical analysis. Leveraging correlation and regression analyses, researchers have shed light on this intricate relationship, advocating for the integration of more nuanced methods like GWR and PCA to refine predictions' precision and locality. Henderson et al. (2007) demonstrated the application of Land Use Regression (LUR) in predicting nitrogen oxides and fine particulate matter concentrations, employing GIS-generated variables to construct models with enhanced spatial resolution (Henderson et al. 2007). This methodology echoes through the work of Hoek et al. (2008), who underscored LUR models' efficacy in modeling pollutants like NO2 and PM2.5 and called for models that incorporate additional predictors, such as wind direction, to increase applicability across various locales (Hoek et al. 2008). Further, Mo et al. (2021) reviewed LST reconstruction methods, categorizing them and emphasizing the importance of validating reconstructed LST datasets, a crucial step for the practical application of remote sensing in environmental studies (Mo et al. 2021). Voogt and Oke (2003) discussed the application of thermal remote sensing in urban areas, particularly in assessing urban heat islands, yet observed a lag in advancing beyond qualitative descriptions to quantitative analysis, suggesting a potential for incorporating PCA for deeper insights (Voogt and Oke 2003). Steinle et al. (2013) pointed towards a paradigm shift towards using sensor technology for detailed spatial and temporal monitoring of pollutant concentrations, which could significantly benefit from advanced statistical techniques including PCA (Steinle et al. 2013). While these studies collectively highlight advanced statistical methods' potential, such as GWR and PCA, in enhancing our understanding of pollution patterns, a direct examination of PCA in creating a pollutant index was not identified, indicating a possible research gap or an area ripe for further exploration.
The correlation between air pollution and LST, particularly in industrializing nations, is an area of growing global concern (Tan et al. 2010; Ahmed et al. 2023). Research has demonstrated a link between changes in land use, often due to industrialization, and intensification of UHI (L. Liu and Zhang 2011). The use of remote sensing data has also proven effective in assessing UHI, as exemplified by a study in Hong Kong (L. Liu and Zhang 2011). The potential exacerbation of worldwide global warming, due to the contribution of air pollutants to LST cannot be ignored, particularly given the prevalence of air pollution in many developing countries. To comprehensively evaluate the spatial–temporal connection of multiple air pollutants and LST, there is a pressing need for new spatial–temporal methods that leverage remote sensing data. Current research underscores the complex interplay between air pollutants, urban land use, and LST, but often falls short in capturing the nuanced dynamics over time and space due to limitations in traditional modeling approaches. For example, studies such as Weissert et al. (2019) and Zimmerman et al. (2020) have made significant strides in understanding pollution variability and the impact of local sources using low-cost sensors and land use regression models. However, these approaches may not fully exploit the potential of remote sensing data to capture the broader spatial extent and temporal variability of air quality and LST across diverse urban landscapes (Weissert et al. 2019; Zimmerman et al. 2020). The reliance on ground-level monitoring and local sensor networks, while invaluable for high-resolution local analysis, may not adequately represent the spatial heterogeneity and temporal patterns captured by satellite observations. This gap highlights the need to develop innovative methodologies that incorporate remote sensing data, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of how LST depends on air pollutants.
Bangladesh, particularly its capital city, Dhaka, has been identified as one of the most polluted urban areas worldwide in terms of air quality (IQAir 2020; Salam et al. 2021; Zaman et al. 2021). A report by the World Bank indicates that from 2018 to 2021, Bangladesh ranked second highest in air pollution levels due in part to rapid urbanization, uncontrolled vehicular regulations, and deforestation (Begum and Hopke 2019; THE WORLD BANK 2022) that are responsible for high levels of PM2.5 from the combustion of fossil fuels (gasoline, oil, and diesel), as well as PM10 from the burning of wood. The precipitous rise in air pollution has exacerbated the UHI phenomenon (Kafy et al. 2020, 2021; Naim and Kafy 2021). Although there is considerable research examining the connection between air pollutants and LST in various regions of Bangladesh, focusing on either single or multiple pollutants, the spatial–temporal relationship between multiple air pollutants and LST at a
