The experimental setup consisted of a quartz cuvette, where the surface condition was manipulated by reacting adsorbed oxygen atoms with gaseous molecular oxygen just before filling the cuvette with ozone. The surface concentration of atomic oxygen was changed by varying the reaction time and temperature. The absorption spectroscopy technique was used to measure the time dependence of ozone concentration, which was then used to derive the pseudo first-order rate constant.
