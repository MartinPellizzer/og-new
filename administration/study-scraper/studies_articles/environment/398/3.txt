The findings provide new mechanistic insights into ozone-assisted oxidation reactions of alkenes with different structures. The results suggest that alkene structure plays a crucial role in determining the reaction pathways and product formation. The decomposition of long-chain CIs observed in this study may be an important factor in the atmospheric chemistry of alkenes, leading to the formation of secondary organic aerosols. Further research is needed to fully understand the implications of these findings for atmospheric and combustion chemistry.
