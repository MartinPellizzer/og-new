Here is a summary of the study in one detailed paragraph, focusing on ozone-related information and data:

The study investigates the tropospheric ozone (O3) among Short Lived Climate Pollutants (SLCFs), which have a warming effect on climate and harm human health and agriculture. The Radiative Forcing from increases in O3 is estimated to be 0.35Â±0.15 Wm-2, indicating its significant impact. Ozone damages plants by causing small stipple-like lesions on leaves, with recent matured leaves being more susceptible than young and old leaves. Optimal conditions for ozone formation occur at high temperatures, solar radiation, low relative humidity, and wind speed, making early summer the worst time in Korea for ozone pollution. Understanding ozone pollution levels and related problems is crucial for agricultural management under climate change.
