The study used twenty-four-hour ambient air quality data of six pollutants (PM10, PM2.5, NO2, ozone (O3), benzene, and toluene) collected from the Central Pollution Control Board portal from January 2019 to December 2023. The data were analyzed using real-time continuous ambient air quality monitoring stations (CAAQMS) established at four different locations in Delhi. The AirQ+ software tool was used for health risk assessment of air pollution, and Origin Pro 2022 was used for graph plotting.
