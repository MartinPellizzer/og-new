The findings of this study highlight the importance of considering the life cycle environmental impacts of renewable energy systems. The results suggest that wind turbines have significant impacts on climate change and other environmental categories, while PEM electrolyzers have higher impacts in terms of ozone depletion. These results can inform policymakers and industry professionals when making decisions about the installation and operation of renewable energy systems.
