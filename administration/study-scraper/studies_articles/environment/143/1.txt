The methods used in this study involved an analysis of Aura's microwave limb sounder data to retrieve hydrolysis rates of dinitrogen pentoxide and nitric acid (HNO3) concentrations in the high-latitude lower stratosphere. Additionally, a novel methodology was employed to retrieve formation pathways of PSCs from spaceborne lidar observations. This involved condensing HNO3 on bushfire aerosols to form Liquid Nitric Acid Trihydrate (LNAT), which was then converted to ice PSCs.
