The findings emphasize the importance of creating a new international agreement that addresses the impact of orbital spacecraft emissions on ozone depletion. This agreement should adhere to existing systematic structures and accommodate on-the-ground issues while maintaining an environmental perspective. The precautionary principle, as outlined in the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, provides a framework for addressing uncertainty and potential risks associated with orbital spacecraft emissions.
