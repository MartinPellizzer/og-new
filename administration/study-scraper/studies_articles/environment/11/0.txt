The Pandonia Global Network (PGN) consists of Pandora spectrometers deployed worldwide to monitor trace gases in the atmosphere. These instruments employ a common algorithm and data protocol for reporting on column densities and lower atmospheric profiles, providing valuable insights into air quality and climate change. To facilitate scientific analysis, the PGN assigns flags to the data indicating high, medium, and low quality. However, researchers often overlook data flagged as low or medium quality, potentially missing opportunities for meaningful results.
