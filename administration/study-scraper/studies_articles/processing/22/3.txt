The findings suggest that ozone plays a crucial role in enhancing the oxidation rate of industrial zinc sulfite by affecting the non-mass transfer control stage. The mass transfer rate of O2 and/or O3 determines the reaction rate in the main stage of the oxidation process. Therefore, ozone can be used to improve the oxidation efficiency of industrial zinc sulfite. Moreover, the study highlights the importance of understanding the mechanism of ozone-enhanced oxidation for optimizing the oxidation process.
