Abstract
Nitrous oxide (N2O) decomposition is increasingly acknowledged as a viable strategy for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and addressing ozone depletion, aligning significantly with the UN's sustainable development goals (SDGs) and carbon neutrality objectives. To enhance efficiency in treatment and explore potential valorization, recent developments have introduced novel N2O reduction catalysts and pathways. Despite these advancements, a comprehensive and comparative review is absent. In this review, we undertake a thorough evaluation of N2O treatment technologies from a holistic perspective. First, we summarize and update the recent progress in thermal decomposition, direct catalytic decomposition (deN2O), and selective catalytic reduction of N2O. The scope extends to the catalytic activity of emerging catalysts, including nanostructured materials and single-atom catalysts. Furthermore, we present a detailed account of the mechanisms and applications of room-temperature techniques characterized by low energy consumption and sustainable merits, including photocatalytic and electrocatalytic N2O reduction. This article also underscores the extensive and effective utilization of N2O resources in chemical synthesis scenarios, providing potential avenues for future resource reuse. This review provides an accessible theoretical foundation and a panoramic vision for practical N2O emission controls.
