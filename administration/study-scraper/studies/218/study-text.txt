Disentangling the chemistry and transport impacts of the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation on stratospheric ozone

Abstract. The quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) in tropical winds perturbs stratospheric ozone throughout much of the atmosphere via changes in transport of ozone and other trace gases and via temperature changes that alter chemical processes. Here we separate the temperature-driven changes using the Department of Energy’s Energy Exascale Earth System Model version 2 (E3SMv2) with linearized stratospheric ozone chemistry. E3SM produces a natural QBO cycle in winds, temperature, and ozone. Our analysis defines climatological QBO patterns of ozone for the period 1979–2020 using both nonlinear principal component analysis and monthly composites centered on QBO phase shift. As a climate model, E3SM cannot predict the timing of the phase shift, but it does match these climatological patterns. We develop an offline version of our stratospheric chemistry module to calculate the steady-state response of ozone to temperature and overhead ozone perturbations, assuming that other chemical families involved in ozone chemistry remain fixed. We find a clear demarcation: ozone perturbations in the upper stratosphere (above 20-hPa) are predicted by the steady-state response of the ozone column to the temperature changes; while those in the lower stratosphere show no temperature response and are presumably driven by circulation changes. These results are important for diagnosing model-model differences in the QBO-ozone responses for climate projections.
