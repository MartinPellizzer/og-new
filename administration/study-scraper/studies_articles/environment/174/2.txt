The results showed that 4 mg/L Ozone MNBs treatment significantly inhibited "green" in soybean sprouts compared to the control group. Specifically, the treatment enhanced the activities of chlorophyllase (Chlase), chlorophyll degrading peroxidase (Chl-POX), Mg-dechelatase (MD) and pheophytinase (PPH), which are responsible for chlorophyll degradation. In addition, the treatment decreased the levels of precursors in chlorophyll synthesis [δ-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and Urogen Ⅲ] and chlorophyll a and b.
