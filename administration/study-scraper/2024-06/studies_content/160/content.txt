Abstract
Fuel Oil (BBM) distribution activities are crucial components of the global energy supply chain, resulting in significant environmental impacts. Therefore, it is important to understand and quantify these impacts through Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). This study uses the ReCipe 2016 method with a gate-to-gate approach, integrating midpoints and endpoints for a comprehensive evaluation. The LCA results show environmental impacts in several categories, including global warming: 0.1453 kg CO2eq, stratospheric ozone depletion: 0.0000000000724 kg CFC11eq, ozone formation affecting human health: 0.00004768 kg NOxeq, fine particulate matter formation: 0.0000010919 kg PM2.5eq, ozone formation affecting terrestrial ecosystems: 0.000031904 kg NOxeq, terrestrial acidification: 0.000007825 kg SO2eq, and water consumption: 0.000657 m3. Endpoint impacts include human health: 0.000000136 daily, and ecosystems: 0.0000000000412 species.yr. The hotspot process unit in fuel distribution activities is the elmot pump. Based on the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), the priority improvement program is the Variable Speed Drive (VSD) program with a weight value of 0.572 or 57.2%. The VSD program is prioritized due to its significant impact on environmental, financial, and technical aspects. The circular economy analysis of the VSD program indicates that it aligns with circular economy principles 1 and 2, leading to reduced electrical energy consumption and decreased GWP emissions from electricity use. In conclusion, this study highlights the importance of targeted improvement programs to mitigate environmental impacts and enhance the sustainability of fuel oil distribution activities.
