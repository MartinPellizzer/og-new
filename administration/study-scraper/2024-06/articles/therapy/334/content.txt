Here are five detailed paragraphs based on the scientific study:

**Paragraph 1**
The debate surrounding the medical use of adjunct oxygen-ozone therapy has sparked controversy in recent times. A commentary published in this journal by Hesley Machado Silva criticized the use of ozone therapy, citing concerns about pseudoscience and denialism. However, the authors of this response argue that the scientific community has extensively studied and documented the efficacy of oxygen-ozone therapy, leading to widespread adoption in medical practice.

**Paragraph 2**
The methods used in our study involved a thorough review of existing literature on oxygen-ozone therapy, including meta-analyses, systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and observational studies. We utilized reputable scientific databases such as PubMed and Scopus to gather information on the topic. Our research aimed to investigate the efficacy of oxygen-ozone therapy in various medical conditions, including COVID-19, myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), post-COVID, aphthous stomatitis, antimicrobial therapy, low back pain, fibromyalgia, and multiple sclerosis.

**Paragraph 3**
Our results showed that oxygen-ozone therapy has demonstrated sound efficacy in various medical conditions. For instance, studies have shown its effectiveness in reducing fatigue symptoms in patients with ME/CFS and post-COVID. Additionally, RCTs have proven the benefits of oxygen-ozone therapy in treating aphthous stomatitis, low back pain, fibromyalgia, and multiple sclerosis. Moreover, case studies have reported improvements in quality of life for patients undergoing oxygen-ozone therapy.

**Paragraph 4**
The discussion surrounding the use of oxygen-ozone therapy is often clouded by misconceptions about pseudoscience and denialism. Our research aims to dispel these myths by presenting a comprehensive review of existing scientific evidence. We argue that the widespread adoption of oxygen-ozone therapy in medical practice is a testament to its efficacy and safety, rather than a result of pseudoscientific beliefs.

**Paragraph 5**
In conclusion, our study demonstrates the effectiveness of oxygen-ozone therapy in various medical conditions. The scientific community has extensively documented its benefits through rigorous research, and it is time to recognize oxygen-ozone therapy as a legitimate medical approach. We hope that our response will contribute to a more informed discussion about the use of adjunct oxygen-ozone therapy and encourage further research into its applications.
