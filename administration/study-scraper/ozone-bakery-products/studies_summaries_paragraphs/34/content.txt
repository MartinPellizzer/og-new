Here is a detailed summary of the study in 1 paragraph, focusing on the information related to ozone:

Deoxynivalenol (DON) is a mycotoxin that poses a risk to human and animal health due to its adverse effects. Recent studies have shown opportunities to reduce DON through food processing, including milling and ozonation. Ozone treatment has been proposed as a new alternative for reducing DON content in wheat, offering a potential solution for the food industry. The study highlights the importance of understanding the stability of DON during food processing, particularly during milling, fermentation, and baking. Additionally, it notes that DON-3-glucoside, a plant metabolite of DON, increases during the breadmaking process, emphasizing the need to prevent its formation.
