Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a significant contributor to climate change, and its emissions are increasing at an alarming rate. Modern agricultural practices have been identified as a major source of these emissions. Denitrification, a truncated pathway that reduces nitrate to nitrogen gas under anaerobic conditions, is responsible for most biological N2O emissions. The denitrification pathway is tightly regulated by transcriptional regulators from the FNR family. Recent studies have explored the role of small RNAs (sRNAs) in regulating denitrification, and it has been hypothesized that sRNAs controlled by FNR transcriptional regulators may also play a key role in this process.
