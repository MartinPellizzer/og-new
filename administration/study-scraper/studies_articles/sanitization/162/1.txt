Methods (100 words)The study used an ozone UFBW generator to produce OUFBW containing varying concentrations of ozone. The solution was then used to degrade recombinant pneumolysin, leukotoxin, and staphylococcal enterotoxin A. Human neutrophils and erythrocytes were isolated from healthy donors and exposed to the toxin-OUFBW solutions or controls. The samples were analyzed using silver staining, western blotting, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay, and optical microscopy.
