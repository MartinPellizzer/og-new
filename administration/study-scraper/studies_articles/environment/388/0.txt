The sun is the primary source of energy for our planet, and its variability in solar irradiance plays a crucial role in shaping Earth's climate. The study by Lean et al. (2024) aims to investigate the relationship between changes in solar irradiance over the past century and global climate change, as well as the recovery of the ozone layer and future space environment impacts on earth-orbiting spacecraft.
