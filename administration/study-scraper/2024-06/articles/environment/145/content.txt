Here are five detailed paragraphs based on the scientific study:

**Paragraph 1**
Introduction
The importance of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in air quality and atmospheric chemistry is well-established. VOCs play a crucial role in ozone formation and secondary organic aerosol production, which can have significant impacts on human health and climate. Despite their significance, VOC emissions are associated with considerable uncertainty due to limitations in emission inventories and models. This study aims to quantify the uncertainty of anthropogenic aromatic VOC emissions in Spain using a combination of bottom-up emissions, air quality modeling techniques, and ground-based observations.

**Paragraph 2**
Methods
This study employed the High-Elective Resolution Modelling Emission System (HERMESv3) model to produce gridded bottom-up emissions, which were then used as input for the Multiscale Online Nonhydrostatic AtmospheRe CHemistry (MONARCH) chemical transport model. The model simulated surface concentrations of benzene, toluene, and xylene across Spain using hourly emission inputs from HERMESv3. The modeling results were evaluated against official ground-based observation data for the year 2019.

**Paragraph 3**
Results
The study found that observed levels of benzene and xylene in industrial sites near coke ovens, refineries, and car manufacturing facilities were significantly higher than modelled concentrations. Official emissions reported by these facilities were replaced with alternative estimates to improve model performance at various stations. In contrast, model results showed consistent overestimations for toluene in background stations due to uncertainties in the spatial disaggregation of emissions from industrial-use solvent activities.

**Paragraph 4**
Discussion
The study highlights the importance of refining emission inventories and models to better represent VOC emissions. The findings suggest that model evaluation and sensitivity analyses are essential for understanding the uncertainty associated with anthropogenic aromatic VOC emissions. Future studies should focus on improving the spatial and temporal coverage of observational data, updating emission factors, and incorporating more detailed information on industrial activities.

**Paragraph 5**
Conclusion
In conclusion, this study has demonstrated the importance of evaluating the uncertainty of anthropogenic aromatic VOC emissions in Spain using a combination of bottom-up emissions, air quality modeling techniques, and ground-based observations. The findings suggest that improving emission inventories and models is crucial for reducing uncertainties associated with VOC emissions and informing effective air quality management strategies. Further research should focus on refining emission estimates, updating model chemical mechanisms, and incorporating more detailed information on industrial activities to improve the accuracy of VOC simulations.
