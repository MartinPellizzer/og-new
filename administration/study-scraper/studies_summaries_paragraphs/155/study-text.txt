Here is a summary of the study in one detailed paragraph, focusing on information related to ozone:

A recent Supreme Court case (23A349-351) examined whether to stay the Federal "Good Neighbor Plan" for the 2015 Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards. The plan aimed to reduce ground-level ozone concentrations by setting stricter emissions limits for power plants and vehicles in nonattainment areas. Data showed that between 2017 and 2020, ozone levels decreased by 1.4% nationwide, but many areas still exceeded the standard. The court's decision could impact the plan's effectiveness in reducing ozone pollution and improving public health.
