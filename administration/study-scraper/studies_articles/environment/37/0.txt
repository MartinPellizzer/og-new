The reaction of 1,2-dichlorobenzene with ozone has been a topic of interest in recent years due to its potential applications in environmental pollution control. Organic solvents, such as dichlorobenzene, are widely used in high-tech industries, resulting in the release of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) into the environment. These VOCs can cause serious damage to human health and the environment. Therefore, it is essential to develop efficient methods for treating VOCs.
