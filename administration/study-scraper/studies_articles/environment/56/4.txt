In conclusion, this study demonstrates the significant synergistic effect of short-term coexposure to PM2.5 and O3 on mortality in China. The findings emphasize the need for more comprehensive air pollution control strategies that account for the joint effects of multiple pollutants. Further research is necessary to better understand the underlying mechanisms driving these interactions and to develop effective mitigation strategies to reduce the burden of air pollution-related deaths.
