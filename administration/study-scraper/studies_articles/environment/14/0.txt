The formation of ozone in urban areas is a complex process influenced by various factors, including volatile chemical products (VCPs), cooking emissions, and nitrogen oxides (NOx). Understanding the impact of these sources on ozone formation is crucial for developing effective air pollution mitigation strategies. A recent study published on the EGU interactive community platform aimed to quantify the contribution of VCPs, cooking emissions, and NOx to ozone formation in the Los Angeles Basin during the summer of 2021.
