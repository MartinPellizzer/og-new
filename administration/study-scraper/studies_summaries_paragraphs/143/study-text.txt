Here is a summary of the study in 1 detailed paragraph:

This study investigates the impact of Australian bushfire emissions on polar stratospheric ice clouds (PSCs) and their role in ozone depletion. Analysis of Aura's microwave limb sounder data revealed enhanced hydrolysis of dinitrogen pentoxide, leading to increased nitric acid (HNO3) in the high-latitude lower stratosphere in early 2020. Using a novel methodology, the authors found that HNO3 condensed on bushfire aerosols, forming 82% Liquid Nitric Acid Trihydrate (LNAT), which rapidly converted to 77% ice, resulting in anomalous high areal coverage of ice PSCs. This highlights the primary formation pathways of ice and LNAT, and could improve simulations of PSC formation and denitrification in climate models. As extreme wildfire events are expected to increase, these findings contribute to a deeper understanding of their impacts on stratospheric chemistry and PSC dynamics.
