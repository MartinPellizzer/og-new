Here is a detailed summary of the study in 1 paragraph, focusing on the information and data related to ozone:

A flexible thin-layer plasma sterilizer based on polyimide was developed for non-thermal and waterless decontamination of bacteria, fungi, and viruses. The device was designed as a sandwich-like structure with an electrode array located between two polyimide films, and its flexibility allowed it to adapt to uneven surfaces. The plasma generation process was characterized by experiment and simulation, and the effects of bending deformation on ozone production were studied. Results showed that the variation in electron impact ionization induced by different curvatures led to changes in microparticle production, affecting macroscopic properties of plasmas. The sterilizer demonstrated high efficacy, reducing S. aureus and P. aeruginosa colonies by 2.5-5 log CFU on flat surfaces after activation for 30-120 seconds. However, the plasma sterilization effect decreased by about 1 log CFU when treating curved surfaces, but was regained after conforming the plasma sterilizer to the curved surface. The study revealed that ozone production increased with bending deformation, indicating the potential feasibility of efficient plasma treatment on 3D objects with irregular surfaces.
