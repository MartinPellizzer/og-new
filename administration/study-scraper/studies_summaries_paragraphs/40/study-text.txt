Here is a detailed summary of the study in 1 paragraph:

The study analyzed the spatiotemporal characteristics and source contributions to ozone (O3) pollution in Siping, a heavy industrial city in Northeast China. The results showed that O3 concentrations were highest during summer afternoons, with hourly peaks up to 254 Âµg/m3. Spatially, O3 pollution was primarily contributed by background concentrations (34.52%), external transport (34.50%), and local emissions (30.98%) during the study period. Among the local emission sources, biological emissions, industrial sector, and traffic sector accounted for 35.30%, 32.09%, and 23.58% of the O3 concentration, respectively. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis revealed that O3 pollution in Siping is co-controlled by anthropogenic volatile organic compounds (AVOCs) and NOX emissions, suggesting joint prevention and control measures are necessary to optimize VOCs and NOx emissions in both industrial and transport sectors.
