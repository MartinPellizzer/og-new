Here is a summary of the study in one paragraph, focusing on the information and data related to ozone:

A clinical, blind, and randomized study evaluated the effectiveness of ozonated oil for internal dental whitening, comparing it to conventional bleaching agents. The study found that adding ozone gas to sodium perborate accelerated dental bleaching, resulting in a greater color variation between the initial and final colors, with fewer clinical sessions required. The study analyzed 42 teeth with endodontic treatment and a degree of dental saturation equal to or greater than A2, divided into two groups: PNaS (sodium perborate + saline solution) and PNaOZ (sodium perborate + ozone sunflower oil with 16 ppm). The results showed that the number of clinical sessions was statistically lower for PNaOZ, indicating a faster whitening process.
