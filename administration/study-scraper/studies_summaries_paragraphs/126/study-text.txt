Here is a summarized paragraph focusing on the information and data related to ozone:

A life cycle assessment (LCA) study reveals that using reclaimed water in hydroponics has significant impacts on marine and terrestrial ecotoxicity as well as photochemical ozone formation. According to the study, reclaimed water consistently demonstrates lower environmental impacts compared to conventional water across various indicators, including climate change, fine particulate matter formation, and freshwater consumption. Specifically, reclaimed water usage reduces climate change by 131 kg CO2 eq., fine particulate matter formation by 0.108 kg PM2.5 eq., and freshwater consumption by 0.291 m3. These findings emphasize the potential of hydroponics with reclaimed water to offer sustainable and environmentally friendly agricultural practices, which is essential for addressing food and water scarcity challenges.
