The results showed that the maximum sulfur removal efficiency of about 91% was obtained at a temperature of 50Â°C, flow rate of 75 ml/min, and time of 4 hours. The study also demonstrated that the DBD plasma reactor was effective in generating ozone with a high concentration, which was essential for the desulfurization process.
