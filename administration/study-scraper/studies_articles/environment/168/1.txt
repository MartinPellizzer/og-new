To create a homogeneous observational record suitable for climate trend analysis, the entire IASI ozone dataset underwent reprocessing. This involved implementing radiance corrections to the raw recorded spectra and ensuring consistent cloud, water vapor, and temperature products were used for ozone retrievals. The EUMETSAT organization distributes near real-time measurements, allowing for the monitoring of ozone trends and exceptional events in both hemispheres.
