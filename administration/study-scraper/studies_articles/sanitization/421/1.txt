The experiments were conducted in a modified hybrid batch reactor with a UV-C lamp, and four operational variables were investigated: applied voltage (5-15 V), ozone dose (0.2-0.8 mg/min), pH (5-10), and catalyst dose (0.5-1.5 g/L). The effects of these variables on turbidity and COD removal were evaluated. Additionally, the study compared the performance of POE with other treatment processes, including ozonation (O3), photocatalytic Ozonation (UV/O3), Electroflucculation (EF)/UV, catalytic ozonation/UV, and Hybrid O3/catalytic ozonation/UV/EF.
