In conclusion, our study demonstrates the importance of considering the Velkhover-Chizhevsky phenomenon in understanding the complex relationships between solar activity, atmospheric circulation patterns, and disease incidence rates. Our findings provide insights into the mechanisms by which changes in solar radiation may influence disease outbreaks and highlight the need for further research to fully understand these relationships.
