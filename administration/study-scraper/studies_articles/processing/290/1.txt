The study employed a Box-Behnken experimental design to examine oxidation desulfurization by non-thermal plasma for various operation conditions, including time, flow rate, and temperature. Acetonitrile was used as the extraction solvent with an oxidized oil/solvent ratio of 1:1 (v/v). The DBD plasma reactor was employed to generate ozone, which was then used as an oxidant in the desulfurization process.
