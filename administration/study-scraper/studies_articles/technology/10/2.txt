The results of this study revealed that ozone possessed superior oxidizing properties compared to chlorine, as evident from UVA254 and EEM analyses. SF-2DCOS and EEM-PARAFAC-2DCOS provided detailed insights into the direction and sequence of these changes. Protein-like substances were found to be the most susceptible to chlorination and ozonation, with different reaction sequences observed for each oxidant. Additionally, variations in protein-like and humic-like components in actual EfOM samples deviated from those in model substances, highlighting the importance of considering specific organic matter variations in real-world samples.
