Abstract
The declining trend in vehicle emissions has underscored the growing significance of volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions from volatile chemical products (VCPs). However, accurately representing VOC chemistry in simplified chemical mechanisms remains challenging due to its chemical complexity including speciation and reactivity. Previous studies have predominantly focused on VOCs from fossil fuel sources, leading to an underrepresentation of VOC chemistry from VCP sources. We developed an integrated chemical mechanism, RACM2B-VCP, that is compatible with WRF-Chem and is aimed at enhancing the representation of VOC chemistry, particularly from VCP sources, within the present urban environment. Evaluation against the Air Quality System (AQS) network data demonstrates that our model configured with RACM2B-VCP reproduces both the magnitude and spatial variability of O3 and PM2.5 in Los Angeles. Furthermore, evaluation against comprehensive measurements of O3 and PM2.5 precursors from the Reevaluating the Chemistry of Air Pollutants in California (RECAP-CA) airborne campaign and the Southwest Urban NOx and VOC Experiment (SUNVEx) ground site and mobile laboratory campaign confirm the model's accuracy in representing NOx and many VOCs and highlight remaining biases. Although there exists an underprediction in the total VOC reactivity of observed VOC species, our model with RACM2B-VCP exhibits good agreement for VOC markers emitted from different sectors, including biogenic, fossil fuel, and VCP sources. Through sensitivity analyses, we probe the contributions of VCP and fossil fuel emissions to total VOC reactivity and O3. Our results reveal that 52 % of the VOC reactivity and 35 % of the local enhancement of MDA8 O3 arise from anthropogenic VOC emissions in Los Angeles. Significantly, over 50 % of this anthropogenic fraction of either VOC reactivity or O3 is attributed to VCP emissions. The RACM2B-VCP mechanism created, described, and evaluated in this work is ideally suited for accurately representing ozone for the right reasons in the present urban environment where mobile, biogenic, and VCP VOCs are all important contributors to ozone formation.

1 Introduction
Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are a major contributor to air pollution in urban areas, and some VOCs are harmful to human health (Shuai et al., 2018; Alford and Kumar, 2021). Through reactions with hydroxyl radicals (OH) and nitrogen oxides (NOx), VOCs fuel the formation of ozone (O3) and secondary organic aerosols (SOA). Short- and long-term exposure to O3 and SOA have been linked to numerous adverse health effects, including cardiovascular and respiratory diseases (e.g., Chen et al., 2007; Baltensperger et al., 2008). As North American cities have seen frequent exceedances of O3 and particulate matter (EPA, 2016), VOCs have been targeted for reduction as a means of improving air quality in urban areas.
Mobile sources have historically been the largest emitter of VOCs in urban areas, but emissions from vehicles have declined due to control strategies. California started implementing regulations reducing emissions of VOCs from vehicles early and aggressively. Since 1970 the California Air Resources Board (CARB) mandated automobile manufacturers meet the nation's initial motor vehicle emission standards, aiming to control VOC and NOx emissions. As a result, VOCs in Los Angeles have decreased by almost 2 orders of magnitude during the past 5 decades (Warneke et al., 2012). However, the declining rate of VOCs has slowed in recent years (Kim et al., 2022), indicating a larger contribution of VOCs emitted from non-mobile sources. VOCs such as isoprene and monoterpene are predominantly emitted from biogenic sources (Guenther et al., 1995), which is expected to increase as a response to urban greening programs and as temperatures rise in the future due to climate change (Livesley et al., 2016; Connop et al., 2016; Gu et al., 2021). Additionally, volatile chemical product (VCP) sources, including solvents, adhesives, cleaning agents, pesticides, and personal care products, constitute half of the fossil fuel VOC emissions in industrialized cities (McDonald et al., 2018b). While a missing OH reactivity of 8–10 s−1 was identified at the Pasadena ground site during the CalNex campaign in 2010, approximately 50 % of the missing OH reactivity is estimated to be due to emissions of unmeasured VCPs (Hansen et al., 2021).
The increasing contribution of VOCs from non-mobile sources alters the response of local ozone formation to VOC budgets. Qin et al. (2021) shows that VCP sources produce 41 % of the total photochemical organic PM2.5 and 17 % of the maximum daily 8 h average ozone in the summer in Los Angeles. Similarly, Coggon et al. (2021) shows that VCPs accounted for more than 50 % of the total anthropogenic VOC contribution to ozone in New York City. The effect of biogenic VOCs from urban vegetation on ground-level ozone has been observed in cities such as Berlin (Churkina et al., 2017) and Beijing (Ma et al., 2019). It is worth emphasizing the temperature dependence of ozone can also be altered. Nussbaumer and Cohen (2020) showed that in Los Angeles, VOCs can be categorized into two groups, one that was more independent of temperature and has been effectively controlled and one that is temperature-dependent, which is now a much larger component of the remaining VOC. While O3 is determined by the relative ratio of NOx and VOCs, the response of temperature effects on ozone is nonlinear. For instance, Nussbaumer and Cohen (2020) found a lower temperature dependence of ozone in 2014–2019 than in 1997–1998.
Representing VOC chemistry in model simulations is challenging due to the number of VOC species and corresponding reactions. It is impossible to incorporate the explicit mechanisms of all VOCs into the 3D chemical transport model due to computational expense. To simplify this, the 3D chemical transport model uses a limited number of individual species or surrogates, where a group of species with similar structure and OH reactivity are lumped together into a surrogate. Previous chemical mechanisms have been simplified to primarily focus on representing the VOC chemistry from mobile sources in detail, given that emissions were historically dominated by mobile sources (Middleton et al., 1990). Consequently, an updated mechanism incorporating more complex chemistry is necessary to accurately represent the varying VOC mixture and VOC chemistry in the present urban environment. Coggon et al. (2021) used the RACM-ESRL-VCP mechanism, which added updates to oxygenated VOC chemistry relevant to VCPs to the RACM-ESRL mechanism (Stockwell et al., 1997; Geiger et al., 2003; Kim et al., 2009; Ahmadov et al., 2012). Several advancements have been made beyond the RACM-ESRL mechanism. As an example, RACM2 (Goliff et al., 2013) was created to update ketones, aromatics, and biogenically emitted compounds. RACM2_Berkeley2.0 included updates to the isoprene oxidation mechanism and monoterpene chemistry, as well as an extended mechanism for organic nitrates (Browne et al., 2014; Zare et al., 2018).
In our study, we developed an updated chemical mechanism based on the RACM2_Berkeley2.0 mechanism, named RACM2B-VCP, which aims to better represent VOCs and VOC chemistry in the present urban environment. By starting with the RACM2_Berkeley2.0 mechanism, mobile VOCs are reasonably represented with the updates in RACM2, and biogenic VOCs are represented well with the updates in RACM2_Berkeley2.0. This work builds from this past work to add improved VCP chemistry to create RACM2B-VCP, an integrated chemical mechanism ideally suited for the present urban environment where mobile, biogenic, and VCP VOCs all need to be accurately represented in order to simulate ozone correctly for the right reasons. We evaluate the RACM2B-VCP mechanism by comparing it against a more simplified but established mechanism RACM-ESRL-VCP and against airborne, mobile, and ground measurements. Due to advancements in VOC measurement techniques, unique VOC tracers emitted by VCPs can now be directly measured (Gkatzelis et al., 2020). By adding these VCP VOC tracers explicitly into the RACM2B-VCP mechanism and comparing them directly to observations, we are able to better constrain emission inventories and identify gaps in our understanding of VCP emissions and chemistry than is possible with more condensed mechanisms. Additionally, because the RACM2B-VCP mechanism is more complex than the RACM-ESRL-VCP mechanism, more tracers for mobile and biogenic emissions and their oxidation products are available to directly compare against observations, which enables a more complete evaluation of VOC emissions and chemistry in general. We also utilize the RACM2B-VCP mechanism to investigate the temperature dependence of ozone, which will provide insights into ozone pollution scenarios in the warming future due to climate change. In this work, we describe the development of the RACM2B-VCP chemical mechanism in Sect. 2, the WRF-Chem configuration in Sect. 3, and the observations used for model evaluations in Sect. 4. We then evaluate how WRF-Chem simulation represents O3, PM2.5 (Sect. 5), NOx, CO, VOCs (Sect. 6), PAN, and speciated aerosols (Sect. 7). Lastly, we investigate the impact of VCP emissions and other anthropogenic VOC emissions on VOC reactivity and O3 (Sect. 8).
2 Development of RACM2B-VCP chemical mechanism
The RACM2B-VCP mechanism is based on the RACM2_Berkeley2.0 mechanism (Browne et al., 2014; Zare et al., 2018), and includes 8 new species (Table S1) and 25 new reactions. In addition, 43 existing reactions are updated to reflect the latest understanding of kinetics and chemistry. The following sections describe the key updates made to RACM2B-VCP.
2.1 Representation of VCP VOC chemistry
Oxygenated VOCs, including methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, glycerol, and acetone, compose a large fraction of VCP emissions. The RACM2_Berkeley2.0 mechanism already includes the degradation of ethanol, methanol, acetone, and ethylene glycol. We add isopropanol, propylene glycol, and glycerol as new species into RACM2B-VCP. The products of OH reactions and the reaction coefficients are the same as those in RACM-ESRL-VCP, which is described in Coggon et al. (2021). Each species serves as a surrogate for other oxygenated VOCs emitted from VCPs, which are largely composed of glycols and glycol ethers. A description of the lumping schemes is provided in the supplemental information of Coggon et al. (2021).
VOC tracers linked to specific VCP categories have been identified in Gkatzelis et al. (2020); therefore, we implement four tracers as separate species in order to validate the VCP emissions as model inputs. These four tracers are D4-siloxane, D5-siloxane, p-dichlorobenzene (PDCBZ) and p-chlorobenzotrifluoride (PCBTF). D4-siloxane and D5-siloxane are predominantly emitted from adhesives and personal care products, respectively. Alton and Browne (2020) and Alton and Browne (2022) determined the kinetics and products of oxidation by the OH radical. The oxidation products of both D4-siloxane and D5-siloxane are C3 and higher alcohols (ROH). D5-siloxane has a higher reactivity towards OH radicals and has a reaction constant of 2.1 × 10−12 cm3 molec.−1 s−1. In contrast, the reaction constant of D4-siloxane with OH is 1.3 × 10−12 cm3 molec.−1 s−1. P-dichlorobenzene and p-chlorobenzotrifluoride are treated as tracers for insecticides and solvent-based coatings, respectively. We assume their products with OH reactions are the same as species with the closest functional structure. We assume that p-dichlorobenzene oxidation by OH yields the same products as benzene, and the reaction
