Here is a summarized paragraph focusing on the information related to ozone:

The study investigates the effectiveness of photocatalytic ozonation-electroflucculation process using modified bentonite/UV/TiO2/ZnO for treating pharmaceutical wastewater. The results show that the optimized conditions, including an applied voltage of 10 V, catalyst dose of 1 g/L, and ozone dose of 0.6 mg/min, achieved a COD removal efficiency of 86.9% and turbidity removal efficiency of 81.66%. Additionally, the process removed 100% of amoxicillin and 95% of carbamazepine from the wastewater. Ozone dose was found to be an important operational variable, with higher doses (0.8 mg/min) resulting in higher COD removal efficiencies.
