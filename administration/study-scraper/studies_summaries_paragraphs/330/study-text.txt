Here is a detailed summary of the study in 1 paragraph, focusing on information related to ozone:

The study investigated the effects of chlorine and ozone disinfection on biofilms and planktonic cells of Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria, with a focus on quorum sensing (QS) signaling. The results showed that combined chlorination and ozonation was the most effective method for inactivating planktonic cells within 10 minutes, while microfluidic chip culture demonstrated that QS signals increased biofilms' disinfection resistance. Transcriptome analysis revealed that exposure to chlorine and ozone significantly altered gene expression in both wild-type strains and QS signaling-deficient mutants, indicating a multilayered response to disinfectant exposure, including oxidative stress, ribosome synthesis, and nutrient absorption. These findings provide insights into the regulatory mechanisms of bacterial QS in response to ozone disinfection, highlighting potential strategies for efficient disinfection processes.
