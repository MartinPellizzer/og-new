Here is a summary of the study in one paragraph:

The Pandora spectrometers deployed worldwide as part of the Pandonia Global Network (PGN) generate data on nitrogen dioxide (NO2), formaldehyde (HCHO), and ozone production. While standard quality assurance flags are used to filter data, this study shows that these flags may not accurately reflect data quality. Instead, independent uncertainty is a better indicator of data quality. By applying an uncertainty filter, up to 90% more scientifically useful data can be obtained from Pandora sites in North America. The study also develops a method for combining direct-sun and sky-scan observations into a single dataset, which provides a more continuous record and allows for stronger correlations with surface ozone measurements.
