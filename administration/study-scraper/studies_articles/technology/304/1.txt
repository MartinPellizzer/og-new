In this study, a model fuel containing organo-sulfur compounds (benzothiophene and dibenzothiophene) was investigated using non-thermal plasma technology. The process involved ozone generation through dielectric barrier discharge followed by extraction using acetonitrile. The experimental setup consisted of a dielectric barrier discharge reactor, an ozone generator, and a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC-MS) for analysis.
