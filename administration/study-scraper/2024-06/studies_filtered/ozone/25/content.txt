Abstract
The two-spotted spider mite (Tetranychus urticae) is a constant threat to greenhouse strawberry production. The application of synthetic acaricides is the main method of controlling T. urticae. However, resistance development to traditional acaricides reduces their efficacy and eventually leads to control failure. It is important for strawberry growers to look for new acaricides and application technologies that can limit the harmfulness of T. urticae in environmentally friendly ways. In the current study, laboratory toxicity tests and field trials were performed to screen high-efficiency acaricides, and then application technologies were improved to enhance the management of T. urticae. In the laboratory toxicity tests, the results showed that the LC50 (median lethal concentration) value of cyetpyrafen, cyenopyrafen, cyflumetofen, bifenazate, abamectin, azocyclotin, pyridaben, spirodiclofen, and etoxazole against adult T. urticae was 0.226, 0.240, 0.415, 3.583, 5.531, 25.58, 39.69, 140.3, and 267.7 mg/L, respectively. In addition, the LC50 value of the nine acaricides against eggs of T. urticae was 0.082, 0.097, 0.931, 18.56, 25.52, 45.61, 36.32, 1.954, and 0.040 mg/L, respectively. The field trial results showed that the best control effect was obtained in cyetpyrafen at 300 mL/ha treatment. Cyetpyrafen was chosen for further application technology tests. In the spray volume tests, the results showed that increasing the spray volume from 900 to 1050 L/ha significantly improved the control of T. urticae. In addition, the results from the spray instrument tests demonstrated that the control effects on T. urticae in the ozone spray treatments were significantly higher than those of the conventional and electrostatic sprays 1 and 3 days after treatment (DAT). Therefore, this study suggested that cyetpyrafen effectively controlled T. urticae both in the laboratory tests and in the field trials. Increasing the spray volume and application of ozone spray significantly improved T. urticae management.

1. Introduction
The strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa) is the most economically important soft fruit species in the world. As the largest strawberry producer and consumer, over 3,981,600 t of strawberry were harvested on 147,450 ha in China, with a gross output value of over 60 billion CNY in 2022 [1]. Strawberry production has had a 5–7% annual increase in China over the past six years. However, with the development of the strawberry industry, pests have become the main problem. Particularly, the two-spotted spider mite (Tetranychus urticae) is considered a constant threat to sustainable strawberry production [2,3]. T. urticae is a polyphagous pest with a short life cycle, a high fecundity, and a great ability to develop acaricide resistance [4,5,6]. The host range of T. urticae covers over 1400 plant species from more than 140 different plant families [7]. T. urticae pests feed mainly on the underside of leaves, leading to reduced photosynthesis and increased transpiration [8]. Due to feeding damage, strawberry quality and quantity can be seriously reduced, with a typical yield loss of 50–80% [9].
Resistant cultivars are the first choice in managing T. urticae [10]. However, the most popular strawberry cultivars in local markets vary significantly in their sensitivity to T. urticae [11]. Moreover, cultural and biocontrol practices are promising strategies, but they have a stability problem under field conditions [12,13]. Commonly, the management of T. urticae relies mainly on the application of chemical pesticides or acaricides due to their easy application and low economic costs. However, this method is not always effective, as T. urticae has a rapid development of resistance to chemical products [4]. Currently, T. urticae develops resistance to most selective acaricides, including more than 96 active ingredients with different modes of action [5,14,15]. Thus, the search for environmentally friendly and highly efficient acaricides is urgently needed for growers to control T. urticae in strawberry production [13].
Many new acaricides have recently been developed for their acaricidal effect in T. urticae management. Cyetpyrafen is the latest acaricide with a mode of action as a complex II (succinate-ubiquinone oxidoreductase) inhibitor in the respiratory chain, firstly commercialized in China in 2017 [16]. It was obtained using cyenopyrafen as the lead compound, by structural modification of the pyrazole ring and hydroxyl portion, having high acaricide activity against all developmental stages of T. urticae. In a recent study, the uptake and metabolism of cyetpyrafen in plants were explored, and the results showed that 13 transformation products of cyetpyrafen had been identified [17]. Cyenopyrafen is a beta-ketonitrile derivative and a recently developed acaricide with the same mode of action as cyetpyrafen [18]. Cyflumetofen is a benzoyl acetonitrile acaricide circulated by Otsuka AgriTechno Co., Ltd. [19]. The above-mentioned acaricides have great potential to control T. urticae. On the other hand, pesticide application technologies, including the ozone and electrostatic spray methods, have developed rapidly in recent years [20,21]. Diversifying control methods is a pivotal strategy in effectively coping with acaricide resistance. In the current study, laboratory tests and field trials were used to screen highly efficacious acaricides to manage T. urticae. Then, the application technologies were optimized to improve their control efficacy on T. urticae. Our findings are valuable for growers optimizing management strategies to control T. urticae sustainably in field conditions.
2. Results
2.1. Laboratory Toxicity Tests
The laboratory toxicity results showed that the LC50 value of cyetpyrafen, cyenopyrafen, cyflumetofen, bifenazate, abamectin, azocyclotin, pyridaben, spirodiclofen, and etoxazole against adult T. urticae was 0.226, 0.240, 0.415, 3.583, 5.531, 25.58, 39.69, 140.3, and 267.7 mg/L, respectively (Table 1). In addition, the LC50 value of the nine acaricides to the eggs of T. urticae was 0.082, 0.097, 0.931, 18.56, 25.52, 45.61, 36.32, 1.954, and 0.040 mg/L, respectively. After an integrated analysis, we further conducted field trials to confirm the control effects of five acaricides, including cyetpyrafen, cyenopyrafen, cyflumetofen, bifenazate, and etoxazole.

2.2. Field Trials
There were no notable differences between the two-year field trials, so the data were pooled. At one day after treatment (DAT), cyetpyrafen at 300 mL/ha, cyenopyrafen at 330 mL/ha, and cyflumetofen at 450 g/ha were most effective in decreasing the mite population, with a control of 83.77%, 81.99%, and 81.57%, respectively, which was significantly better compared to the other treatments (Figure 1). Moreover, the control effect of etoxazole at 180 mL/ha was inferior to that of the other treatments. The remaining treatments had medium effects. At 3 DAT, cyetpyrafen at 300 mL/ha had the best control effect (Figure 2). Cyenopyrafen at 330 mL/ha and cyflumetofen at 450 g/ha had slightly weaker control effects in reducing the population of mites, but they were better than bifenazate at 450 mL/ha and the other treatments. At 7 and 14 DAT, a similar trend to 1 DAT was observed (Figure 3 and Figure 4). However, etoxazole at 180 mL/ha had the lowest control effects. Overall, the higher rates of cyetpyrafen, cyenopyrafen, and cyflumetofen had better control effects and lasted longer compared to the other treatments.

The same letters above the columns indicate that the values are not statistically different (p < 0.05).
2.3. Application Technology Tests
Based on the above results, the best treatment—cyetpyrafen at 300 mL/ha—was used in the field trials to verify the better spray volume and method for improving the management of T. urticae. At 1 and 3 DAT, the control effects on T. urticae in strawberries receiving spray volumes of 600 and 750 L/ha were 78.35% and 82.59% and 81.60% and 84.40%, respectively, which were significantly lower values than those of a conventional spray with a volume of 900 L/ha (83.01% and 85.46%, respectively) (Figure 5). However, the control effects on T. urticae at the spray volumes of 1050 and 1200 L/ha were notably (p < 0.05) higher than those of a conventional spray. At 7 DAT, the control effect of the spray volume of 600 L/ha was 90.80%, which was lower than that of a volume of 900 L/ha. There were no differences between the other treatments. At 14 DAT, no significantly differences were observed among all the treatments.

Control effect (%) = (the decrease rate in the control mite population − the decrease rate in the treated mite population)/(100 − the decrease rate in the control mite population) × 100. The data are represented as the mean ± standard deviation of the mean and separated with Tukey’s HSD test. The same letters above the columns indicate that the values are not statistically different (p < 0.05).
The control effects on T. urticae were further analyzed for different spray methods. The results showed that the control effects on T. urticae in the ozone spray treatments (88.35% and 92.41%, respectively) were significantly higher compared to the conventional spray (83.43% and 90.01%, respectively) and the electrostatic spray (85.54% and 90.51%, respectively) at 1 and 3 DAT (Figure 6). However, these differences disappeared at 7 and 14 DAT.
