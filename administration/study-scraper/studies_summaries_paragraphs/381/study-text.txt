Here is a detailed summary of the study in one paragraph, focusing on the information and data related to ozone:

The study investigated the interaction between ozone and the autoxidation of 1-hexene over a wide temperature range (300-800 K), overlapping atmospheric and combustion regimes. It was found that atmospheric molecular mechanisms initiate the oxidation of 1-hexene from room temperature up to combustion temperatures, leading to the formation of highly oxygenated organic molecules. As temperature rises, thermal decomposition of ozone into oxygen atoms becomes dominant above 650 K, resulting in a remarkable enhancement of conversion due to their diradical nature. The study also demonstrated the formation of heavy oxygenated organic molecules at low temperatures (below 400 K) through the combination of synchrotron-based mass-selected photoelectron spectroscopy and orbitrap chemical ionization mass spectrometry.
