The study was conducted at a demonstration facility in San Diego, California, with a treatment capacity of 3,785 m3/d. The treatment train consisted of ozone/BAC as pretreatment followed by membrane-based full advanced treatment (FAT). The ozone/BAC process involved chemical oxidation and biological growth to reduce total organic carbon (TOC) levels. The FAT train included membrane filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light (UV) advanced oxidation process (AOP).
