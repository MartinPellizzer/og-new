Wildfires have become an increasing concern globally due to their devastating impacts on both human health and the environment. The main objective of this study was to examine the associations between short-term exposure to wildfire-related ozone (O3) pollution and daily all-cause, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality across various regions and populations worldwide. With a focus on wildfires, which are a significant source of O3 pollution, this study aimed to fill the existing research gaps by analyzing the health effects and health burden of wildfire-related O3 exposure globally.
