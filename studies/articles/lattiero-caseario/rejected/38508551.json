    "abstract": "The study aimed to improve the quality and storage stability of novel plant-based soymilk with the incorporation of untreated (Ut\u03b2G) and modified oat derived 1,4-\u03b2-D-glucan (Oz\u03b2G) at varying concentrations (0, 1, and 2\u00a0% labelled as S<sub>0</sub>, S<sub>1</sub> and S<sub>2</sub>). The treated soymilk was characterized for physical, chemical, nutritional, rheological, particle size, zeta potential, sensory and storage stability characteristics. The results revealed that 1, 4-\u03b2-D-glucan incorporation increased the acidity (0.67 to 0.73\u00a0%), viscosity (3.4 to 4.7 Cp) and ash content (0.74 to 0.92\u00a0%), however color remains natural. The frequency sweep and shear experiments showed that the 1,4-\u03b2-D-glucan modified the rheological parameters of the soymilk. The sensory analysis (n\u00a0=\u00a030) indicated that texture, mouthfeel and overall acceptability (8.38). Compared to Oz\u03b2G-treated soymilk, Ut\u03b2G soymilk, especially S<sub>2</sub>, exhibited superior thickening and rheological properties. The storage study indicated minimal phase separation in 1,4-\u03b2-D-glucan-incorporated samples, maintaining stability for 15\u00a0days under refrigerated conditions without compromising overall quality. Thus, this study provides valuable insights into the potential application of 1,4-\u03b2-D-glucan for improving the technological quality of soymilk that highlights possible implications for its commercialization potential."
