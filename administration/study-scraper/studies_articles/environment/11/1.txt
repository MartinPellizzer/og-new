To assess the suitability of these data quality flags, this study evaluated Pandora observations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and formaldehyde (HCHO), critical precursors controlling tropospheric ozone production. The researchers applied an independent uncertainty filter to examine the reliability of data flagged as medium or low quality. To evaluate the effectiveness of this filtering method, they correlated contemporaneous but independent direct-sun and sky-scan observations from 15 Pandora sites in North America.
