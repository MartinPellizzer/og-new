In conclusion, this study demonstrates the ability to retrieve upper stratospheric ozone profiles from SCIAMACHY limb-scattered solar radiance using WMART and SCIATRAN. The results show good agreement with other datasets, demonstrating the potential of this technique for studying the atmosphere at high altitudes. Further research can focus on expanding the altitude range and improving the retrieval accuracy to provide more detailed information on the atmosphere's composition and behavior.
