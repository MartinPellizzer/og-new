Here is a summary of the study in one detailed paragraph:

The study evaluated the feasibility and effectiveness of ozone technology for disinfecting infectious solid waste in hospitals. Spores of Bacillus atrophaeus were used to monitor the inactivation process, with results showing that 100% removal was achieved within 30 minutes for non-compacted waste and 50 minutes for compacted waste using wet ozone injection through a glass column or separate water vapor injection into a contact tank. The study found that ozone technology effectively inactivated microbial agents in medical solid waste, achieving complete removal of B. atrophaeus at different contact times.
