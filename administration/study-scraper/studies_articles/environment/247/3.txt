The discussion of this study highlights the significance of wind field factors in improving spatial interpretability. The use of dynamic graph sequences enabled the model to capture the complex relationships between meteorological factors and ozone concentration. The results also suggest that the STD-GCN can be applied to other regions with similar pollution issues. Future studies could explore the integration of additional factors, such as atmospheric chemistry and land use patterns.
