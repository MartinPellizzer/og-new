Abstract
The city consists of a complex set of types of uses and the relationships between them, and the pattern of urban land use, as a link connecting urban uses and activities, plays a very important role in the production and distribution of environmental pollution. The effect of land use patterns on the distribution of pollutants and the subsequent increase in air pollution and its impact on citizens' health makes it important to consider urban land use patterns. In this regard, the attitude of health buffer reduces the exposure to pollutants by absorbing or blocking part of the pollution and thus reduces the concentration of pollutants. This research aims to describe the spatial-place changes of air pollutants in the west of Tehran metropolis with the view of creating health buffers by identifying the influential components in air pollution in the west of Tehran, with field observations and air quality monitoring data, information for spatial analysis in ArcGIS software is examined. and finally, by overlapping the layers, he has defined health buffer zones around sensitive uses such as schools, hospitals, and residential areas. The findings indicate that the pattern of urban land use has an effect on the spatial distribution of air pollution, and the industrial areas in the south of the range (area 21) due to the accumulation of industrial and workshop uses have caused the expansion and spread of pollutants and have the largest share in air pollution. has had studies at the level of the range. The implementation of zoning regulations and health buffer strategies that prioritize the separation of polluting activities from sensitive uses can effectively prevent human exposure to pollutants and make cities healthier and more sustainable environments create for their residents.In urban areas, environmental crises often appear in different forms due to the concentration of the human population, industrial activities, and infrastructure development. One of the key environmental crises in urban environments includes air pollution caused by vehicle emissions, industrial activities, etc. (WHO, 2022), while rapid urbanization often leads to the loss of green spaces such as parks. and forests (World Bank, 2022), which has caused the release of many pollutants that cause many heart and respiratory diseases (Hamidi et al, 2022). It is that social life is formed by its use and development and it makes the main structure of city planning to be based on land use management. In urban air pollution, land use has a vital and fateful role; Because the results of population studies, economy, etc. are reflected in the use of the land, and in this way it manifests in physical-spatial terms and this is while the use of the land through the distribution of activities or through the effect it has on the urban form and trips. It can affect air pollution; Therefore, the distribution of uses in the city should be done in such a way that it does not aggravate air pollution. In developing countries, including Iran, the issue of air pollution due to rapid urbanization and the creation of heavy industries around cities has always been one of the most important environmental challenges on most days of the year, hence the need to pay attention to studies environment is important.The current research is applied in terms of purpose and descriptive research in terms of data collection method. To identify the current situation according to the desired dimensions, a spatial analysis technique has been used in this research, for this purpose, spatial buffers have been used to extract indicators and variables of land use patterns effective in air quality, and measuring pollutants The air and intended uses have been carried out focusing on 7 air pollution measurement stations in the west of Tehran. In this technique, the state of air pollutants, under the title of standard pollutants, including six pollutants, ozone (O3), suspended particles (PM: Particulate Matter), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), lead and carbon monoxide (CO) in Around 7 air pollution measurement stations with buffers of different radii (from 500 to 2000 meters) with the help of interpolation and the IDW method (which is a method for predicting uncertain values for any geographical point such as altitude, precipitation, chemical concentration, air pollution level, etc. .) by using known measured values, and in the second step, information related to the land use pattern in each buffer with the aim of identifying the main sources of pollution, based on the estimation of human health effects, has been identified and specified; It should be noted that some of the buffer uses (Harim Lake, Mesil and Highway, etc.) are considered based on the standards of the Supreme Council of Urban Planning and finally by superimposing the layers and re-interpolating the data. The survey of spatial statistics has been done with a focus on creating a health buffer with overlapping ranges and suggestions for these ranges have been provided.
Land use patterns change over time, reflecting changes in the natural, economic, and social environment to meet population needs. Therefore, the strategy of physical separation of polluting sources and sensitive uses under the title of health buffer is suggested as an effective solution for urban planners at the local and regional scale. In addition, the spatial distribution of land use in urban areas plays an important role in shaping differences in exposure to air pollution among population groups. Vulnerable communities, including low-income, densely populated neighborhoods, often bear a disproportionate burden of air pollution due to their proximity to industrial facilities and transportation corridors. The key findings of this research show that land use patterns have a significant effect on the amount of air pollution. Industrial areas and areas with high traffic density are known as the main sources of pollutants that emit a range of harmful substances such as particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, and volatile organic compounds. On the contrary, green spaces and areas with low density residential development are associated with improved air quality and act as a natural buffer against pollution. The pattern of urban land use affects the spatial distribution of air pollution, and the industrial areas in the south of the region (region 21) have caused the spread of pollutants due to the accumulation of industrial and workshop uses and have contributed the most to the air.
