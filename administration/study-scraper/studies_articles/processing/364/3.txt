The accelerated aging technique using UV/Ozone demonstrated high performance in simulating the natural aging process of wool fabric samples. The results suggest that artificial aged wool textile samples can be quickly created for experimental purposes, providing valuable insights for conservation research and testing of materials. This eco-friendly approach offers a promising alternative to traditional methods, which often require lengthy periods of exposure to environmental factors.
