To achieve this goal, three natural dyes (Turmeric, madder, and cochineal) were used to dye new wool fabrics with different mordants (alum, potassium dichromate, and copper sulfate). The resulting dyed wool samples were then subjected to UV/Ozone aging for varying durations. The morphology and mechanical properties of the samples were analyzed using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and tensile strength tests.
