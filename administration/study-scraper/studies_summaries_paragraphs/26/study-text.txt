Here is a summary of the study in one detailed paragraph, focusing on ozone data and information:

A 20-year surface ozone (O3) pollution analysis in China reveals enhanced fine-scale estimations and environmental health implications. The study uses advanced modeling techniques to estimate O3 concentrations at a high spatial resolution, showing that eastern China is the most severely affected region. During summer, average daily O3 concentrations exceeded 150 μg/m³, exceeding the national ambient air quality standard, while in some areas, levels reached up to 300 μg/m³. The study highlights the importance of addressing ozone pollution in China, as it can have significant health impacts, including increased respiratory problems and premature mortality.
