Abstract
We present an analysis of high-resolution, near-infrared (NIR) spectra relative to the solar transit of Venus of 5-6 June 2012, as observed with the Facility Infrared Spectropolarimeter (FIRS) at the Dunn Solar Telescope in New Mexico. These observations offer the unique opportunity to probe the upper layers (between ∼84 and 150 km in altitude) of a thick, CO2-dominated atmosphere with the transmission spectroscopy technique – a proxy for future studies of highly-irradiated atmospheres of Earth-sized exoplanets. We were able to visually identify absorption lines from the two most abundant CO2 isotopologues, and from the main isotopologue of CO in the retrieved spectrum of Venus. Furthermore, we perform a cross-correlation analysis of the transmission spectrum using transmission templates generated with petitRADTRANS. With the cross-correlation technique, it was possible to confirm detections of both CO2 isotopologues and CO. Additionally, we retrieve a cross-correlation signal for O3 on Venus. We demonstrate the feasibility of high-resolution, ground-based observations to study the chemical inventory of planetary atmospheres, employing techniques commonly used in exoplanet characterization.
