The study employed photocatalytic oxidation and ozonation within wastewater treatment using surface fixed catalysts and UV-A LEDs. The process enabled the formation of hydroxyl radicals by photo-excitation of titanium dioxide semiconductor material. Different approaches were taken to construct photocatalytic reactors, with their effectiveness and efficiency unknown in the context of Germany's 4th treatment stage. Additionally, the combination of photocatalysis and ozonation was explored, allowing for a synergetic increase in efficiency.
