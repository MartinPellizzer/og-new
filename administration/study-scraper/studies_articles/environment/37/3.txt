The results of this study provide insight into the mechanism of the reaction between 1,2-dichlorobenzene and ozone. The formation of products containing C=O and O-H functional groups suggests that a condensation reaction may have occurred between the reactants. The presence of these functional groups in the products also implies that the reaction may be initiated by an electrophilic attack on the benzene ring by ozone, followed by a radical-mediated process.
