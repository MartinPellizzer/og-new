In conclusion, this study demonstrates the potential benefits of using reclaimed water in hydroponic systems. The results show that reclaimed water can significantly reduce the environmental impacts compared to conventional water. Therefore, promoting the use of reclaimed water in hydroponics can be a viable strategy for addressing food and water scarcity challenges while minimizing environmental impacts. Further research is needed to explore the applicability of this approach in different contexts and to optimize its sustainability benefits.
