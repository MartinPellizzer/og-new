The Pearl River Delta (PRD) region of China is known for its severe ozone (O3) pollution, which poses significant threats to human health and the environment. To mitigate this issue, accurate prediction models for O3 concentration are essential. However, predicting O3 concentration is a complex task due to the dynamic uncertainty involved. In recent years, machine learning algorithms have shown promise in tackling such problems. This study aims to develop a time-space ozone prediction model based on a Dynamic Graph Convolutional Network (STD-GCN) to address O3 pollution in the PRD region.
