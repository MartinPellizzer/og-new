Here is a summary of the study in 1 paragraph, focusing on the information and data related to ozone:

The IASI satellite mission has collected a 17-year radiance dataset, allowing for the retrieval of temperature, ozone, and nitric acid profiles day and night from pole to pole. The reprocessed ozone dataset has been used to analyze global distributions over time, revealing changes since 2007. The study highlights the impact of sudden stratospheric warming events in both hemispheres on total ozone distributions, with a notable example being the January 2022 Hunga Tonga volcano eruption's influence on the ozone vertical distribution in the Southern Hemisphere. Additionally, the dataset has been used to monitor the ozone hole and analyze exceptional events such as stratospheric intrusions and sudden stratospheric warmings.
