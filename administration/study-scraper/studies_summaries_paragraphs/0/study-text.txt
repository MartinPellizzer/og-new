Here is a summary of the study in 1 detailed paragraph, focusing on information and data related to ozone:

Ozone therapy has been investigated as a potential treatment for chronic pain in the lower limbs. A systematic review of 32 studies found that ozonotherapy showed promise in alleviating acute and chronic pain in patients with various conditions, including degenerative joint diseases, peripheral neuropathies, and circulatory disorders. Topical, subcutaneous, venous, and rectal applications of ozone were used, with varying degrees of success. Some studies reported significant reductions in pain scores, while others found improvements in quality of life and functional capacity. The review highlights the need for further research to determine the optimal dosage, duration, and application method of ozonotherapy for chronic pain management. Despite limitations, the evidence suggests that ozonotherapy may be a valuable adjunctive treatment option for patients with chronic lower limb pain who have not responded to conventional therapies.
