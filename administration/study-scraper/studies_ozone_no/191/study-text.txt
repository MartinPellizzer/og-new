Abstract
The Sentinel-5 Precursor (S5P) satellite operated by the European Space Agency has carried the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) on a Sun-synchronous low-Earth orbit since 13 October 2017. The S5P mission has acquired more than 5 years of TROPOMI nadir ozone profile data retrieved from the level 0 to 1B processor version 2.0 and the level 1B to 2 optimal-estimation-based processor version 2.4.0. The latter is described in detail in this work, followed by the geophysical validation of the resulting ozone profiles for the period May 2018 to April 2023. Comparison of TROPOMI ozone profile data to co-located ozonesonde and lidar measurements used as references concludes to a median agreement better than 5 % to 10 % in the troposphere. The bias goes up to −15 % in the upper stratosphere (35–45 km) where it can exhibit vertical oscillations. The comparisons show a dispersion of about 30 % in the troposphere and 10 % to 20 % in the upper troposphere to lower stratosphere and in the middle stratosphere, which is close to mission requirements. Chi-square tests of the observed differences confirm on average the validity of the ex ante (prognostic) satellite and ground-based data uncertainty estimates in the middle stratosphere above about 20 km. Around the tropopause and below, the mean chi-square value increases up to about four, meaning that the ex ante TROPOMI uncertainty is underestimated. The information content of the ozone profile retrieval is characterised by about five to six vertical subcolumns of independent information and a vertical sensitivity (i.e. the fraction of the information that originates from the measurement) nearly equal to unity at altitudes from about 20 to 50 km, decreasing rapidly at altitudes above and below. The barycentre of the retrieved information is usually close to the nominal retrieval altitude in the 20–50 km altitude range, with positive and negative offsets of up to 10 km below and above this range, respectively. The effective vertical resolution of the profile retrieval usually ranges within 10–15 km, with a minimum close to 7 km in the middle stratosphere. Increased sensitivities and higher effective vertical resolutions are observed at higher solar zenith angles (above about 60°), as can be expected, and correlate with higher retrieved ozone concentrations. The vertical sensitivity of the TROPOMI tropospheric ozone retrieval is found to depend on the solar zenith angle, which translates into a seasonal and meridian dependence of the bias with respect to reference measurements. A similar although smaller effect can be seen for the viewing zenith angle. Additionally, the bias is negatively correlated with the surface albedo for the lowest three ozone subcolumns (0–18 km), despite the albedo's apparently slightly positive correlation with the retrieval degrees of freedom in the signal. For the 5 years of TROPOMI ozone profile data that are available now, an overall positive drift is detected for the same three subcolumns, while a negative drift is observed above (24–32 km), resulting in a negligible vertically integrated drift.

1 Introduction
Atmospheric ozone is an Essential Climate Variable (ECV) monitored in the framework of the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS). This is motivated by stratospheric ozone's decisive impact on the radiation budget of the Earth, while tropospheric ozone is the third most important anthropogenic contributor to greenhouse radiative forcing. Ozone, moreover, plays a central role in the oxidation chemistry of the atmosphere (Monks et al., 2015) and is an important air pollutant. Exposure to high levels of ozone can cause respiratory issues and be detrimental to health, vegetation, and materials. Studies related to atmospheric composition and the Earth's radiation budget therefore require accurate monitoring of the horizontal and vertical distribution of ozone at the scale of interest (WMO, 2010).
Atmospheric ozone concentration profile data records have been retrieved from backscattered solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation measurements by nadir-viewing satellite spectrometers since the 1960s, starting with the former USSR Kosmos missions in 1964–1965 (Iozenas et al., 1969) and NASA's Orbiting Geophysical Observatory in 1967–1969 (Anderson et al., 1969) and Backscatter Ultraviolet (BUV) on Nimbus 4 in 1970–1975 (Heath et al., 1973) and continuing with the Solar BUV series (SBUV(/2)) after 1978 (Heath et al., 1975). The Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME) in 1995–2002 (Burrows et al., 1999) paved the way to new-generation sounders including the SCanning Imaging Absorption spectroMeter for Atmospheric CHartographY (SCIAMACHY) on board ENVISAT (Bovensmann et al., 1999), the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) on the Earth Observing Satellite (EOS) Aura launched in 2004, the GOME-2 instruments on the Meteorological Operational (MetOp) satellites since 2006 (Munro et al., 2016; Hassinen et al., 2016), and the Ozone Mapping Profiler Suite (OMPS) nadir series started in 2011 (Flynn et al., 2006). Ensuring the uninterrupted continuation of this global monitoring of ozone and other trace gas concentrations is a requirement of the European Earth Observation Programme Copernicus (Ingmann et al., 2012). The Copernicus Space Component plans a series of three Sentinel-5 atmospheric composition missions, jointly developed by the European Space Agency (ESA) and the European Commission and to be operated by the EUMETSAT aboard its satellites MetOp-SG-A1 (Meteorological Operational – Second Generation), MetOp-SG-A2, and MetOp-SG-A3, scheduled in 2024, 2031, and 2038, respectively. As a gap-filler between the heritage satellites and the upcoming Sentinel-5 series, Sentinel-5 Precursor (S5P) was launched in October 2017 with the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument as a unique payload (TROPOMI; Veefkind et al., 2012).
Being the first atmospheric composition mission of the European Union's Copernicus Earth Observation Programme, the Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite is dedicated to the global atmospheric monitoring and study of air quality, climate forcing, ozone, UV radiation, and volcanic hazards. On board the S5P early-afternoon polar-orbiting satellite, the imaging spectrometer TROPOMI performs nadir measurements of the Earth's radiance from the UV-visible to the short-wave-infrared spectral ranges at a much finer spatial resolution than its predecessors do – and from which the global distribution of several atmospheric trace gases is retrieved daily, including stratospheric and tropospheric ozone. Developed at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI) and based on the optimal estimation method, TROPOMI's operational ozone profile retrieval algorithm has been implemented into the S5P Payload Data Ground Segment (PDGS), providing both near-real time (NRTI; for 50 % of the pixels by following a chequerboard pattern) and offline (OFFL) level 2 ozone profile data that are freely accessible from the Copernicus Data Space (https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/, last access: 26 June 2024).
Several scientific TROPOMI ozone profile retrieval products have been developed as well. First by Zhao et al. (2020), using an optimal estimation retrieval algorithm previously applied to GOME, GOME-2, OMI, and OMPS. Mettig et al. (2021) followed with the TOPAS (Tikhonov regularised Ozone Profile retrievAl with SCIATRAN) algorithm, which has also been used for joint UV–IR (infrared) retrievals from TROPOMI and the Cross-track Infrared Sounder on the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (CrIS/Suomi-NPP). A similar combination of TROPOMI UV and CrIS IR retrieval wavelengths has been exploited by the MUlti-SpEctra, MUlti-SpEcies, MUlti-SEnsors (MUSES) retrieval algorithm, which is a core part of the TRopospheric Ozone and its Precursors from Earth System Sounding (TROPESS) pipeline developed by Malina et al. (2022). An additional TROPOMI ozone profile product is currently under development at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL, UK) within ESA's Climate Change Initiative (CCI) on ozone. It is based on the existing RAL UV-Vis processor (v2.14 to v3.01; see Keppens et al., 2018; Pope et al., 2023).
The first objective of this article is to provide an extensive description of the ozone profile retrieval processor currently used for S5P operational data processing (Sect. 2). This processor has also been used to back-process the entire TROPOMI level 1B version 2 data record, providing a homogeneous 5-year record of level 2 ozone profile data, denoted as L2__O3__PR version 2.4.0. The second objective of this work is to summarise the comprehensive quality assessment (QA) of this TROPOMI ozone profile data record, whereby results are collected from both the ESA/Copernicus Atmospheric Mission Performance Cluster's operational Validation Data Analysis Facility (ATM-MPC VDAF) and the S5P Announcement of Opportunity (AO) Validation Team (S5PVT) activity CHEOPS-5p. The QA approaches used are detailed in Sect. 3. They are based on the same validation practices as developed for and applied to the heritage sounders (Keppens et al., 2015, 2018). The validation methodology relies on the analysis of data retrieval diagnostics and on comparisons of TROPOMI data with co-located ground-based measurements used as a reference. The latter are acquired by ozonesondes contributing to the World Meteorological Organization's (WMO) Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) and its data networks, by tropospheric lidars affiliated with the Tropospheric Ozone Lidar Network (TOLNet; Leblanc et al., 2018), and by stratospheric lidars affiliated with the Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change (NDACC; De Mazière et al., 2018). QA results are collected in Sect. 4. The dependence of TROPOMI's ozone profile information content and uncertainty on several influence quantities (like solar zenith angle and surface albedo) and measurement parameters (like the scan angle) is examined and discussed. This work concludes with an examination of the product compliance with mission requirements and consistency with other TROPOMI ozone retrievals, enabling data users to verify the fitness for purpose of the operational S5P ozone profile data. Conclusions are provided in Sect. 5, while some more detailed tables and figures are collected in the Supplement.
2 Operational TROPOMI ozone profiling
2.1 Instrument description and status
The TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument is the unique payload on the Copernicus S5P satellite, the first atmospheric composition mission in the European Union Copernicus Earth Observation Programme (Ingmann et al., 2012). S5P was launched into a Sun-synchronous low-Earth orbit on Friday, 13 October 2017, and, with a foreseen mission lifetime of 7 years, is still fully operational today. The ascending node of the satellite orbit crosses the Equator at 13:30 local solar time. The four imaging spectrometers of TROPOMI measure the spectral radiance scattered at nadir from the sunlit part of the atmosphere and the solar spectral irradiance in the 270–2385 nm wavelength range at 0.2–0.5 nm resolution. The field of view at nadir produces ground pixels of 5.5 × 3.5 km2 (along-track × across-track) since the pixel size switch of 6 August 2019 and of 7 × 3.5 km2 before. The large swath width of 2600 km across-track produces a nearly daily coverage of the global (sunlit) atmosphere, with narrow gaps between orbits at the Equator. After spectral and radiometric calibration of the Earth radiance and solar irradiance data (Kleipool et al., 2018; Ludewig et al., 2020), operational data processors retrieve the total column abundance of several atmospheric trace gases related to air quality, climate, UV radiation, and environmental hazards. For ozone, a full vertical profile is retrieved.
2.2 Ozone profile retrieval algorithm
The operational TROPOMI ozone profile algorithm developed at KNMI derives the ozone concentration as a number density at 33 pressure levels throughout the atmosphere from the TROPOMI reflectance observations in the wavelength region between 270 and 330 nm, provided by bands
