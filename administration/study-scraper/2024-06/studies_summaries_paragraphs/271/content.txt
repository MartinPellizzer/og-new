Here is a summary of the study in one detailed paragraph focusing on ozone-related information:

Researchers have developed a novel experimental-numerical approach to determine the tearing energy threshold for crack growth in rubber exposed to ozone. The study focuses on carbon black reinforced natural rubber and finds that the tearing energy threshold under ozone exposure is a maximum of 2.12 J/mÂ², which is 96% lower than the threshold value for non-ozone-exposed specimens. This reduced threshold is attributed to the oxidative cleavage process caused by ozone, leading to the formation of ozone cracks on the rubber's surface. The research highlights the importance of characterizing this physical parameter as it underlies the practical ozone resistance of rubber products. The novel approach involves in-situ optical analysis of ozone crack growth on the rubber surface and determination of the crack growth rate when the rubber is stretched, followed by calculation of energy release rates using finite element method software. This methodology represents a powerful tool for efficient development of environmentally friendly antiozonants, as it allows researchers to quantify the influence of different antiozonants on the tearing energy threshold under ozone exposure.
