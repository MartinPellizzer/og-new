The method employed in this study involved using short UV wavelengths of 302, 312, and 322 nm and a long wavelength of 331 nm for wavelength pairing to simplify the retrieval algorithm. The weighted multiplicative algebraic reconstruction technique (WMART) was used in combination with a radiative transfer model (SCIATRAN). The WMART is straightforward to understand and easy to implement, producing stable results. The retrieval error estimates for the upper stratosphere were provided, and the total retrieval error of the ozone profile was usually <18% in the altitude range of 30-53 km.
