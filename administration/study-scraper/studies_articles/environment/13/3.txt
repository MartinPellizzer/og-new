The findings suggest that maternal exposure to atmospheric pollutants is associated with an increased risk of preterm birth, particularly during mid-pregnancy (T2). The results imply that reducing exposure to these pollutants could potentially reduce the risk of preterm birth. However, further research is needed to confirm these findings and investigate the mechanisms underlying this association.
