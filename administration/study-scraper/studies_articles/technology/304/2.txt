The results demonstrated the efficient oxidation and removal of dibenzothiophene and benzothiophene by non-thermal plasma. The desulfurization efficiency reached 93.78% under the optimum conditions, including a voltage of 11Kv, temperature of 50ÂºC, duration of 4 hours, and a flow rate of 75 ml/min. GC-MS analysis revealed that the majority of the sulfur compounds were removed during the oxidation process.
