Abstract

The
 antibacterial,
 anti-inflammatory
 and
 tissue-regenerative

qualities of ozone therapy have attracted a great deal of interest

in the dental community. The history, workings and uses of ozone

treatment in the fields of oral pathology, conservative dentistry and

endodontics, periodontics, pedodontics, oral surgery, oral medicine

and
 temporomandibular
 joint
 (TMJ)
 problems
 are
 all
 covered

in length in this comprehensive overview. To establish the long-

term advantages of ozone therapy in dentistry and standardize

treatment regimens, this review highlights the need for advanced

research in this field.
