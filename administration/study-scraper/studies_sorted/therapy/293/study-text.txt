Abstract
Ozone is getting more and more attention as a treatment method used in alternative medicine. It is stated that ozone has many positive effects on animal health. In this review, the uses of ozone in animal health were examined. Ozone is used to increase blood circulation and oxygenation, as it increases the use of oxygen in the body. Ozone, thanks to its antioxidant properties, shows anti-inflammatory effects and strengthens the immune system. The anti-aging feature of ozone, which is reported to be used in the treatment of infections, is also known. Ozone therapy is gaining increasing acceptance as an alternative medicine treatment method and can be effective in the treatment of many health problems.
