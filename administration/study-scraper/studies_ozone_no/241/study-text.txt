Abstract
Background: Several studies suggest that environmental and climatic factors are linked to the risk of mortality due to cardiovascular and respiratory diseases; however, it is still unclear which are the most influential ones. This study sheds light on the potentiality of a data-driven statistical approach by providing a case study analysis. Methods: Daily admissions to the emergency room for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases are jointly analyzed with daily environmental and climatic parameter values (temperature, atmospheric pressure, relative humidity, carbon monoxide, ozone, particulate matter, and nitrogen dioxide). The Random Forest (RF) model and feature importance measure (FMI) techniques (permutation feature importance (PFI), Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) feature importance, and the derivative-based importance measure ( κ A L E )) are applied for discriminating the role of each environmental and climatic parameter. Data are pre-processed to remove trend and seasonal behavior using the Seasonal Trend Decomposition (STL) method and preliminary analyzed to avoid redundancy of information. Results: The RF performance is encouraging, being able to predict cardiovascular and respiratory disease admissions with a mean absolute relative error of 0.04 and 0.05 cases per day, respectively. Feature importance measures discriminate parameter behaviors providing importance rankings. Indeed, only three parameters (temperature, atmospheric pressure, and carbon monoxide) were responsible for most of the total prediction accuracy. Conclusions: Data-driven and statistical tools, like the feature importance measure, are promising for discriminating the role of environmental and climatic factors in predicting the risk related to cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Our results reveal the potential of employing these tools in public health policy applications for the development of early warning systems that address health risks associated with climate change, and improving disease prevention strategies.

1. Introduction
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of global mortality, surpassing all other health conditions [1]. Among these, ischemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease are predominant. However, respiratory diseases (RDs), including lower respiratory infections and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, are also major causes of death [2]. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), climate change is likely to impact human health both directly, through temperature fluctuations, and indirectly, through changes in disease vectors [3] (p. 2).
A comprehensive review of the existing scientific literature has revealed that rising temperatures will likely lead to an increase in morbidity and mortality related to weather conditions, with a significant portion of deaths linked to cardiovascular events [4,5,6]. Several studies conducted across different parts of the world have confirmed that extreme temperatures increase the risk of mortality due to CVDs and RDs [7,8,9,10,11]. It has been observed that heatwaves can cause mortality rates from cardiovascular diseases to range from 13% to 90%, cerebrovascular diseases from 6% to 52%, and respiratory diseases up to 14% [12]. In the United States, approximately 5600 heat-related deaths occurred annually from 1997 to 2006 across 297 counties [13]. Episodes like the July 2006 heatwave in California confirm the substantial incidence of emergency room visits for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases [14], recording about 140 deaths on July 15 and August 1 of the same year. Studies in nine U.S. cities identified a 1.8% increase in mortality associated with increases in apparent temperature [15]. Similarly, in North America, a 4.7 °C increase in average daily temperature was correlated with a 2.6% increase in cardiovascular mortality [16]. Furthermore, in regions where the temperature in the hottest months exceeds 30 °C, each degree increase is associated with a 3% increase in mortality [17]. In Europe too, an analysis across 15 European cities reported a strong correlation between heatwaves and mortality due to respiratory diseases [16]. Similar associations between temperature and mortality have also been observed in China, where an increase in risk occurs at both low and high temperatures [18]. Overall, analyses of daily mortality rates have highlighted that both low and high temperatures are associated with an increase in mortality from CVDs [19]. In fact, regarding CVDs, a strong positive correlation was demonstrated between maximum temperature and mortality (r = 0.83, p < 0.01), in addition to a significant negative correlation between minimum temperature and mortality [19]. Numerous studies have highlighted that the winter period is correlated with a marked increase in cardiovascular diseases and deaths related to them, especially in regions of the Northern Hemisphere characterized by particularly cold temperatures [10,20]. Specifically, daily rates of cardiovascular events increase with decreases in average air temperature, with a 10 °C decrease associated with a 19% increase in daily rates of cardiovascular events for individuals over 65 years [21].
These studies provide robust evidence of the health impacts of extreme temperatures, using large datasets and rigorous statistical analyses to highlight the significant increase in mortality rates during heatwaves and cold spells. However, many of these studies rely on aggregated data, which can obscure individual-level variations and the influence of other confounding factors. Additionally, they primarily focus on maximum temperatures, potentially overlooking the significant effects of minimum temperatures on health outcomes.
It must be emphasized that climate change not only affects temperature, but also has adverse effects on other environmental conditions, particularly air pollution [22]. Recent works have further explored the complex relationships between various meteorological factors (i.e., higher solar radiation, atmospheric pressure, humidity, and wind) and cardiovascular and respiratory diseases [23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30].
These studies underscore the limitations of frequently using linear models, which may not fully capture the complex, non-linear relationships between atmospheric pressure and health outcomes. Moreover, there is often a lack of consideration for the interaction between atmospheric pressure and other environmental factors, which could influence the results. Nevertheless, challenges related to the spatial and temporal variability of air pollution data can affect the accuracy and generalizability of findings. Additionally, the potential confounding effects of other environmental and socio-economic factors are not always fully accounted for, which can limit the robustness of conclusions.
The investigation into the relationships between meteorological factors and cardiovascular and respiratory diseases is vital, especially given the seemingly discordant views presented by existing research. Delving deeper into the influence of environmental parameters on disease patterns is crucial for illuminating specific aspects of these interactions and for enhancing our understanding of the nuanced relationships between climate, health, and disease.
Currently, an increasing amount of clinical, biometric, and biomarker data are available, and the use of artificial intelligence (AI)—and in particular machine learning (ML)—in healthcare has introduced new research perspectives and applications. These technologies’ ability to analyze vast amounts of data manifests in various areas, from more precise disease surveillance to advanced image interpretation and optimized healthcare operations management. A recent literature analysis confirmed the effectiveness of ML techniques in analyzing clinical data, offering valuable insights for early diagnosis and disease management [31,32,33]. These results suggest that ML models in specific clinical contexts outperform traditional methods, offering more accurate predictive models. Several papers [31,32,33,34,35,36,37] have delved deeply into ML applications for medical diagnoses and predictions, from cardiovascular diseases to patients’ clinical deterioration and respiratory diseases. These studies employed a variety of algorithms, including neural networks (i.e., multilayer perceptron, recurrent neural network, convolutional neural network (CNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), etc.), support vector machine, boosting methods like RF, and combinations of techniques such as CNN and LSTM, achieving high predictive performance (AUC of 0.809) [38].
In ML, understanding the importance of features is critical to clearly interpreting how the model works internally. A variety of ML techniques have been introduced in the literature to quantify feature importance both globally and locally. Specifically, the former helps to assess the global impact of features on ML model prediction, while the latter enables quantifying the specific contribution of features in each individual prediction. Feature importance measures are interpretability techniques, and belong to explainable artificial intelligence methods that help the user to understand and trust the results provided by ML models.
In healthcare and water science, a variety of these techniques have been applied, proving their potential [39,40,41,42,43]. Specifically, Ref. [42] offered a comparison of a multitude of global importance measures by considering several case studies that can mimic real-world hydrological scenarios. This analysis shows that the most robust feature importance measures are permutation feature importance (PFI) [44], Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) feature importance [45,46], and the derivative-based importance measure ( κ A L E ) [41].
A study conducted at the Policlinico Giovanni XXIII in Bari (Italy) [47] highlighted AI’s ability to model correlations between climatic conditions and the incidence of CVDs. Using feature importance techniques derived from the RF algorithm, meteorological variables such as average, maximum, and apparent temperature, along with relative humidity, were identified as key indicators of hospitalizations related to CVDs.
Starting from the analysis conducted in [47], our goal is to extend the previous research by applying a set of feature importance measures that have proven to be robust and effective in identifying key factors in hydrological applications [42]. We compare the results to gain a comprehensive view of which factors most affect the risk of mortality due to cardiovascular and respiratory diseases.
Our study builds on this existing body of research by addressing some of the limitations identified in the literature. By employing the Random Forest (RF) model, we handle complex, non-linear relationships and interactions between multiple environmental factors. The integration of Seasonal Trend Decomposition using LOESS (STL) for data pre-processing effectively isolates trend components from seasonal and irregular noise, enhancing the robustness and accuracy of our predictions. Furthermore, our use of feature importance measures (PFI, SHAP, κALE) allows for a flexible and comprehensive analysis that is adaptable to various machine learning models and datasets. This approach not only enhances predictive accuracy, but also improves model interpretability, providing actionable insights for policymakers and healthcare providers.
