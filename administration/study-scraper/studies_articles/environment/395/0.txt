The SCanning Imaging Absorption spectroMeter for Atmospheric CHartographY (SCIAMACHY) instrument has been measuring atmospheric scattered radiance since its launch in March 2002. With three geometric observation modes, nadir, occultation, and limb, it provides valuable data on the atmosphere's composition and behavior. This study focuses on retrieving upper stratospheric ozone profiles from SCIAMACHY limb-scattered solar radiance using the weighted multiplicative algebraic reconstruction technique (WMART). The objective is to establish a simple and effective retrieval scheme to derive reliable ozone profiles at high altitudes.
