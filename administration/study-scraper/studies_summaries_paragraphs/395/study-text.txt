Here is a summary of the study in 1 detailed paragraph, focusing on the info and data related to ozone:

The study retrieved upper stratospheric ozone profiles from SCIAMACHY Hartley-Huggins limb scatter spectra using WMART. The results showed that the retrieval error estimates for the upper stratosphere were typically <18% in the altitude range of 30-53 km. The retrieved ozone profiles agreed with SCIAMACHY v3.5 data within -10% to 5%, except at an altitude of 45 km, where a larger bias occurred (-15%). Comparisons with OSIRIS v7.1 and ACE-FTS v4.0 showed differences within Â±10% for 30-53 km altitude, with some errors being <5%. The study highlights the simplicity and effectiveness of the WMART retrieval scheme in deriving reliable ozone profiles at high altitudes from UV spectral bands.
