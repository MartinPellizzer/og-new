To address these uncertainties, this study employed a combination of experimental and theoretical approaches. Before conducting gas phase reactions experimentally with Fourier Transform-CIMS (FT-CIMS) in TARLA AECL, the Plugged Flow Reactor (PFR) model was selected and modeled using CHEMKIN Pro software. Additionally, Gaussian 16 and ChemRate software were used to model the kinetic processes of the reactions.
