Here are five detailed paragraphs based on the scientific study provided:

**Paragraph 1**
Ozone in the troposphere plays a crucial role in the oxidation of chemically and climatically relevant trace gases. Urban ozone is photochemically produced from nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from primarily anthropogenic sources. In recent years, ozone pollution has been a recurring problem throughout China, especially in central and southern China. As a result, researchers have developed various detection methods to measure the types and concentrations of air pollutants in the atmosphere, including lidar systems. Differential absorption lidar is an advanced tool for investigating tropospheric ozone transport and development.

**Paragraph 2**
The ozone differential absorption lidar system used in this study includes a high-efficiency Raman frequency-shifting source and a multi-wavelength grating spectrometer. The system equation for the atmospheric backscatter echo signal was derived, taking into account atmospheric extinction coefficients, aerosol extinction, and absorption by other gases. System error corrections were applied to minimize their effect on the ozone concentration inversion calculation. The effective vertical resolution of the ozone lidar system was determined using a Fernald algorithm.

**Paragraph 3**
A comparison experiment between the ozone lidar data and ozone data collected via an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) was conducted at the Canton Tower in Guangzhou, China. The results showed that the two datasets were generally in agreement, with a statistical error of about 40% when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was less than 10, decreasing to less than 15% when the SNR was greater than 20, and mostly less than 8% when the SNR was greater than 40.

**Paragraph 4**
The accuracy evaluation of the differential absorption lidar system was further validated by a long-term comparison experiment using data from the Canton Tower. The results confirmed the viability of the ozone lidar optomechanical structure and the atmospheric correction algorithm, both in real-time and over a given time duration. This study quantified the relationship between statistical errors within the lidar data and SNR, which enables quick and accurate determination of the quality of any given set of ozone lidar data.

**Paragraph 5**
In conclusion, this study evaluated the accuracy of a differential absorption lidar system for ozone detection using a comparison experiment with UAV data. The results confirmed the reliability and accuracy of the system, with statistical errors inversely proportional to the SNR. This study provides valuable insights into the performance of the system and its potential applications in environmental monitoring and research.
