The results demonstrate the feasibility of retrieving upper stratospheric ozone profiles from SCIAMACHY limb-scattered solar radiance using WMART and SCIATRAN. The simplicity and effectiveness of the retrieval scheme make it a valuable tool for studying the atmosphere's composition and behavior at high altitudes. The comparison with other datasets validated the accuracy of the retrieved ozone profiles.
