Results (100 words)The study found that OUFBW treatment abolished the toxicity of pneumolysin, leukotoxin, and staphylococcal enterotoxin A. Silver staining confirmed the degradation of these toxins following OUFB treatment. The LDH assay showed a significant decrease in cytotoxicity against human neutrophils exposed to OUFB-treated toxin solutions. Furthermore, optical microscopy revealed reduced cellular damage after exposure to OUFB-treated toxin solutions.
