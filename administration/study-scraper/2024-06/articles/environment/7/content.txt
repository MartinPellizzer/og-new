Here are five detailed paragraphs based on the scientific study:

**Paragraph 1: Introduction**
The study investigated the spatial and temporal accumulation patterns of 6 PPD-Q in greenbelt soils in Ningbo, China. 6 PPD-Q is an ozone-induced byproduct derived from the degradation of N-(1,3-dimethylbutyl)-N′-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine (6 PPD), commonly found in road dust resulting from tire wear. The extent of 6 PPD-Q pollution in urban soil remains unclear, and this study aimed to clarify the spatio-temporal variation characteristics of 6 PPD-Q content in soils with different traffic densities alongside urbanization gradients.

**Paragraph 2: Methods**
The study collected soil samples from areas with varying traffic densities in Ningbo city, encompassing urban, peri-urban, and rural locales. The sampling depth was the topsoil layer of 0–10 cm, and the sampling points were all within 2 m from both sides of the road. To provide a comprehensive representation of the urbanization gradient, our sampling sites were strategically positioned along the spectrum.

**Paragraph 3: Results**
The study found that the accumulation of 6 PPD-Q in winter was generally higher than that in summer, with hotspot areas for high 6 PPD-Q content predominantly located at high-speed intersections, traffic-heavy road junctions, and congestion-prone routes. Notably, the concentration of 6 PPD-Q varied significantly with urbanization gradients, with the highest concentrations detected in urban areas.

**Paragraph 4: Discussion**
The results suggest that soil fungi exhibit higher sensitivity to 6 PPD-Q accumulation compared to bacteria. Co-occurrence network analysis reveals that the bacterial microbial network in summer exhibits greater stability and resilience in response to 6 PPD-Q inputs than in winter. Long-term accumulation of 6 PPD-Q weakens the nitrogen and phosphorus cycling potential within urban soil, while the enhancement of carbon cycling may further promote 6 PPD-Q degradation.

**Paragraph 5: Conclusion**
The study provides new insights into the ecological risks of 6 PPD-Q in urban soils. The accumulation of 6 PPD-Q varies significantly with urbanization gradients, and hotspot areas for high 6 PPD-Q content are predominantly located at traffic-heavy road junctions. The results highlight the importance of considering the impact of 6 PPD-Q on soil microbial communities and element cycling in urban soil environments.
