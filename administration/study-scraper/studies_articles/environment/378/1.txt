The three-component nanocomposite Fe2O3/MgO/MoS2 was synthesized using the hydrothermal method for the first time. The catalyst's structure and properties were characterized by various methods, including X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). To optimize the photocatalytic ozonation process, response surface methodology (RSM) was employed using a Box-Benken design to analyze and optimize the parameters of the process.
