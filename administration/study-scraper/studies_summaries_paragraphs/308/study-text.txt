Here is a summary of the study in 1 detailed paragraph:

A recent study analyzed long-term changes in surface ozone (O3) concentrations over the North China Plain (NCP) from 2015 to 2021. The results show an annual increase of 12.77 µg m− 3 in summer maximum daily 8-hour average O3 concentration from 2015 to 2019, followed by a decline since 2020. Satellite-based formaldehyde (HCHO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) columns were used to track volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions, revealing that the increase in HCHO column and the sharp decline of NO2 column led to no decrease in O3 concentration and even contributed to O3 enhancement in most areas from 2015 to 2019. However, the decline of HCHO and NO2 columns since 2020 contributed to the decline of O3 concentration. The optimal ratio of HCHO to NO2 for reducing O3 concentration was determined to be 4.66 for the NCP.
