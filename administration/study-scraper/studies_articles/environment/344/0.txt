Ozone (O3) is a critical atmospheric pollutant that poses significant threats to human health and environmental sustainability. In recent years, concerns about O3 pollution have intensified due to the rapid urbanization and industrialization of cities like Lhasa, located in the Tibetan Plateau. As a result, understanding the intricacies of O3 formation in such cities has become increasingly important for developing effective control strategies. This study aimed to investigate the sensitivity of ozone production in Lhasa, a highland city with unique environmental conditions.
