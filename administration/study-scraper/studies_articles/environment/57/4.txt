The conclusions of this study emphasize the importance of continued monitoring of stratospheric ozone and temperature over Germany and worldwide to understand future changes. As atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases are expected to continue rising, while ODS concentrations decline, it is essential to track these trends to inform climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies.
