Here is a detailed summary of the study in 1 paragraph, focusing on the information and data related to ozone:

A study published in the journal Digital Health estimated the change in disease burden associated with influenza and air pollutants during the COVID-19 pandemic in Hong Kong. The research found that excess deaths from all causes, cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, pneumonia, and influenza attributable to influenza A and B significantly decreased in all age groups compared to the pre-pandemic period. However, excess deaths associated with ozone (O3) increased in all age-disease categories during the pandemic. According to the study, O3 concentrations remained at a relatively low level during the pandemic, except for a sudden drop in early 2020. The results suggest that while the containment measures implemented during the pandemic significantly reduced mortality from influenza, they may have inadvertently increased mortality due to ozone pollution. The study used a machine learning approach to estimate the disease burden attributable to influenza and environmental factors, including air pollutants like O3, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and particulate matter less than 10 Î¼m in diameter (PM10).
