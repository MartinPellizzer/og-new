P-nitrophenol (PNP) is a widely used organic synthetic raw material that can cause significant environmental pollution. Due to its toxicity and persistence in the environment, PNP has been identified as a priority pollutant by international authorities. The development of efficient and sustainable technologies for the removal of PNP from wastewater is essential for protecting public health and the environment. This study aimed to investigate the catalytic ozonation of PNP using a novel Cu2S/Ni3S2@NF catalyst, which was synthesized through a simple hydrothermal method.
