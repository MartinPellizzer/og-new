Abstract
Observations of March 2024 Arctic total column ozone set a record high of 478 Dobson Units (DU) against the 1979-2023 satellite era time series. It was about 60 DU higher than average and 6 DU higher than the previous March 1979 471 DU record. Daily Arctic ozone was above average for every day in March 2024, and set record highs from 11 to 26 March 2024. Microwave Limb Sounder data show this record ozone anomaly was concentrated in the lower stratosphere (10-30 km). These record values developed over the 2023-2024 winter and can be associated with vertically propagating planetary-scale wave events that caused significant stratospheric warmings. These wave events forced poleward and downward ozone advection into the lower stratosphere, leading to record column ozone levels. The above average levels persisted through June 2024 and will likely continue over the entire 2024 summer across the northern hemisphere.
