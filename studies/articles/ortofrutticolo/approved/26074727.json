    "abstract": "<i>B</i><i>rassicaceae</i> vegetables, among them broccoli and Chinese cabbage, are well recognized due to the nutritional properties. Four-week-old Chinese cabbage and broccoli seedlings were fumigated with O<sub>3</sub> for 3\u00a0days before being transplanted into the field. The effect of O<sub>3</sub> treatment was determined after reaching marketable quality (ca. 10\u00a0weeks). The inflorescences of O<sub>3</sub>-treated broccoli were enriched in vitamin E (\u03b1-tocopherol and \u03b3-tocopherol), whereas Chinese cabbage heads had an increased content of anthocyanins and \u03b2-carotene. Ozone treatment did not significantly affect the productivity of both examined vegetables."
