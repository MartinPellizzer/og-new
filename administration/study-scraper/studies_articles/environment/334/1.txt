To identify sRNAs regulated by FNR transcriptional regulators, a search was conducted for putative FNR binding motifs upstream of promoter regions on the Paracoccus denitrificans genome. Seven candidate sRNAs with such motifs within 200 bp of their promoters were identified and computationally characterized to investigate their secondary structures, mRNA targets, and sequence conservation in other bacterial species.
