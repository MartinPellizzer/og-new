The methods used in this study included collecting data from medical records of preterm and full-term deliveries between January 2018 and December 2019. The data included general information such as pregnancy times, number of cesarean sections, occupation, season of conception, and regularity of the menstrual cycle. Confounding factors affecting preterm birth were inferred using the chisquare test. The effects of exposure to six atmospheric pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, and O3) during pregnancy on preterm birth were explored using a logistic regression model with pollutants introduced as continuous variables.
