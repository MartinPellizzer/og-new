The methods used included sampling air from different environments within the incubation plant using the SAS (surface air system) device before and after ozone treatment. Agar nutrient medium was used to count mesophilic aerobic bacteria, while chromogenic media were used to differentiate Escherichia coli and coliforms. Sabouraud agar was used for fungal growth. Samples were taken at 24 and 48 hours of incubation.
