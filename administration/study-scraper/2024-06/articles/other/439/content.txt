Here are the five detailed paragraphs based on the scientific study:

**Paragraph 1**
The tropical tropopause inversion layer (TIL) is a critical region in the atmosphere where the temperature profile undergoes a significant change. Kelvin waves, which are an important type of wave in the TIL, play a crucial role in the dynamics of the upper atmosphere. Recently, studies have shown that the Kelvin wave temperature amplitudes in the TIL exhibit distinct characteristics compared with those in other height levels. However, the modulation mechanisms of the TIL Kelvin waves remain unclear. This study aims to investigate the differences in the variabilities and modulation factors of TIL Kelvin waves over two longitude regions: the Maritime Continent (MC) and the Pacific Ocean (PO).

**Paragraph 2**
The data used in this study is extracted from Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) radio occultation (RO) temperature data from multiple missions from January 2007 to December 2020. The TIL Kelvin waves are extracted using a wavelet analysis method, which allows for the detection of the frequency and amplitude of the waves. The study focuses on two longitude regions: MC (90°–150°E) and PO (170°–230°E). The zonal-mean zonal winds and static stability are also analyzed to investigate their effects on the TIL Kelvin waves.

**Paragraph 3**
The results show that ENSO leads to opposite variations of TIL Kelvin wave temperature amplitudes during different ENSO phases. During La Niña, the strong deep convection over MC and PO leads to strengthened static stability, resulting in stronger TIL Kelvin wave temperature amplitudes over both regions. Conversely, during El Niño, the weak deep convection leads to weakened static stability, resulting in weaker TIL Kelvin wave temperature amplitudes. The zonal-mean zonal winds also affect the TIL Kelvin wave temperature amplitudes by two mechanisms: the prevalence of easterlies/westerlies in the upper troposphere and the dissipation on the critical line.

**Paragraph 4**
The discussion highlights the significance of this study, which fills a research gap in understanding the dynamics of TIL Kelvin waves. The results demonstrate that ENSO plays an important role in modulating the TIL Kelvin wave temperature amplitudes, and that zonal-mean zonal winds have a significant impact on the temporal variations of the TIL Kelvin waves. Additionally, the study suggests that the static stability has a strong effect on the annual variation of TIL Kelvin wave temperature amplitudes.

**Paragraph 5**
In conclusion, this study demonstrates the importance of considering both ENSO and zonal-mean zonal winds when investigating the variabilities and modulation factors of TIL Kelvin waves. The results provide new insights into the dynamics of the upper atmosphere and highlight the need for further research on the modulation mechanisms of TIL Kelvin waves. The study also has implications for understanding the role of TIL Kelvin waves in modulating the climate, as well as their impact on the predictability of weather patterns.
