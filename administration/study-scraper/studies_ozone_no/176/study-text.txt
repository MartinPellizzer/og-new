Abstract
This research seeks to solve the multi-faceted problem of waste disposal by analyzing the application of waste plastic and tyre material within non-structural concrete to ensure more sustainability and less environmental degradation. Study focusses on material properties including specific gravity, water absorption and bulk density and characteristics of the concrete that is produced by the utilization of the above waste aggregates including workability, compressive strength, flexural strength and tensile strength. This paper employs secondary data collection and MATLAB in the analysis of the findings pointing to the fact that the mechanical properties reduce with the level of waste content yet emphasizing the green aspect of such materials. Thus, a complex and diverse effect is demonstrated by the life cycle assessments (LCA) for global warming, ozone depletion, terrestrial ecotoxicity, and acidification. Furthermore, the utilization of waste materials decreases the compressive, flexural, and tensile strength, but it provides distinct ecological benefits which prove the importance of proper mix proportions for concrete performance. The outcomes of this research will be useful for further investigation in the application of the concept as well as to call for the development of new ideas for the improvement of bonding of wastes to aggregates in concrete.
