In conclusion, this study demonstrates the effectiveness of Ozone MNBs treatment in inhibiting "green" in soybean sprouts. The mechanism underlying this effect involves the regulation of enzyme activities and substance levels involved in chlorophyll synthesis and degradation. These findings provide valuable insights into the development of new methods for improving the quality and nutritional value of soybean sprout, which is an important crop in many Asian countries. Further research is needed to explore the potential applications of Ozone MNBs treatment in food processing and storage industries.
