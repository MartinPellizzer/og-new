In conclusion, this study provides valuable insights into the changes in EfOM composition and structure during chlorination and ozonation. The findings highlight the superiority of ozone over chlorine in terms of oxidizing properties. The study's results also underscore the importance of considering specific organic matter variations in real-world samples, as well as the potential of advanced spectroscopic methods to quickly assess the effectiveness of oxidation processes in wastewater treatment systems. This research has significant implications for the management and mitigation of undesired byproducts in water treatment processes.
