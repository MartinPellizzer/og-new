Here is a summary of the study in one detailed paragraph:

The study investigates the oxidative desulfurization of model fuel containing organo-sulfur compounds (benzothiophene and dibenzothiophene) using non-thermal plasma technology. The process involves ozone generation through dielectric barrier discharge, followed by extraction using acetonitrile. The results show that the non-thermal plasma efficiently oxidized and removed dibenzothiophene and benzothiophene, with a desulfurization efficiency reaching 93.78% under optimal conditions of 11kV voltage, 50Â°C temperature, 4-hour duration, and 75 ml/min flow rate. These findings demonstrate the potential of non-thermal plasma technology for efficient sulfur removal from fuel, which is essential to reduce environmental pollution and improve fuel quality.
