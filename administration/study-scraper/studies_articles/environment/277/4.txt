In conclusion, this study provides new insights into the associations between short-term exposure to wildfire-related O3 pollution and daily mortality rates globally. The results highlight the importance of considering the health impacts of wildfires in climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies. By understanding the relationships between wildfire-related O3 exposure and mortality, policymakers can develop targeted interventions to reduce the risks associated with these events and protect public health.
