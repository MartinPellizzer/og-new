**Paragraph 1**
Ground-level ozone pollution is a significant environmental concern, with detrimental effects on both human health and vegetation. To combat this issue, researchers have been exploring alternative catalytic approaches for ozone decomposition. This study proposes a novel design strategy for ozone decomposition using Cu-Mn bimetallic oxide catalysts. The approach involves the synthesis of defect-rich Cu-Mn oxides through a potassium-driven low-temperature oxidation process.

**Paragraph 2**
To synthesize the Cu-Mn oxide catalyst, a combination of computational and experimental methods was employed. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to design the optimal structure of the Cu-Mn oxide, while subsequent experiments involved the synthesis of the catalyst through a potassium-driven low-temperature oxidation process.

**Paragraph 3**
The results show that the defect-rich Cu-Mn oxide catalyst exhibits significantly enhanced reaction rates compared to pristine Cu-Mn oxides. The introduction of copper not only increases the surface area of the catalyst but also offsets the negative effects of oxygen vacancies, which can lead to O2 poisoning. Moreover, DFT calculations reveal that the MnO2(100) facet is a crucial active phase, where oxygen vacancies simultaneously enhance O3 adsorption and decomposition.

**Paragraph 4**
The findings suggest that the synergistic interplay between Cu and oxygen vacancies plays a key role in enhancing the efficacy of the Cu-Mn oxide catalyst for ozone decomposition. The defect-rich structure allows for increased reactant accessibility and reactivity, while the copper dopants mitigate the negative effects of oxygen vacancies.

**Paragraph 5**
In conclusion, this study demonstrates a promising approach to ozone decomposition using Cu-Mn bimetallic oxide catalysts. By incorporating computational and experimental methods, the research highlights the importance of defect-rich structures and synergistic interplay between Cu and oxygen vacancies in enhancing reaction rates. Future studies can build upon these findings to explore further optimizations and applications for this novel catalytic design strategy.
