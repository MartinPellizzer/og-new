Here are five detailed paragraphs based on the provided study:

**Paragraph 1**
Air pollution is a significant environmental problem that poses risks to human health and the environment. The increasing population growth in large cities has intensified air pollution, which has been exacerbated by various factors such as the rise in the utilization of heating devices, industrial centers, commercial activities, and fossil fuels for transportation and traffic. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 91% of the world's population is exposed to high levels of air pollution, leading to three million annual deaths.

**Paragraph 2**
To address this issue, a novel approach was proposed by integrating an autoencoder (AE) with a convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm in Tehran city, Iran. The study utilized spatial data containing the annual average of six pollutants from 2012 to 2022. Various parameters influencing air pollution were considered, including altitude, humidity, distance to industrial areas, NDVI, population density, rainfall, distance to streets, temperature, traffic volume, wind direction, and wind speed.

**Paragraph 3**
The proposed methodology enabled spatial modeling and risk mapping of six air pollutants: particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5), particulate matter 10 (PM10), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), and carbon monoxide (CO). The model accuracy was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for each pollutant. Results showed that NO2, PM10, CO, PM2.5, O3, and SO2 exhibited high accuracy values of 0.964, 0.95, 0.896, 0.878, 0.877, and 0.811, respectively.

**Paragraph 4**
The study demonstrated the CNN-AE model's impressive precision in generating pollution risk maps. The results highlighted the importance of considering various factors influencing air pollution when modeling and mapping air quality. The proposed methodology can be applied to other cities with similar environmental conditions to provide accurate predictions of air pollution risks. Furthermore, the study's findings emphasize the need for diligent air quality monitoring and regulation to protect public health.

**Paragraph 5**
In conclusion, this study presents a novel approach to air quality management by integrating an AE with a CNN algorithm in Tehran city, Iran. The proposed methodology enabled spatial modeling and risk mapping of six air pollutants and demonstrated high accuracy values. The results highlight the importance of considering various factors influencing air pollution when modeling and mapping air quality. The proposed methodology can be applied to other cities with similar environmental conditions to provide accurate predictions of air pollution risks.
