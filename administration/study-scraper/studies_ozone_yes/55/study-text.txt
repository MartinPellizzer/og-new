Abstract
The ozone destruction was studied in a quartz cuvette. The time dependence of ozone concentration was measured by absorption spectroscopy. From this time dependence the pseudo first-order rate constant was derived. This rate constant depends on surface condition - the surface concentration of adsorbed oxygen atoms. This surface concentration was changed by reactions of adsorbed oxygen atoms with gaseous molecular oxygen just before the cuvette was filled by ozone. The decrease of atomic oxygen surface concentration leads to the decrease of rate constant for ozone destruction. The measured rate constants were in range 9.0 × 10−5 s−1 to 9.8 × 10−5 s−1.
