Our findings provide evidence for the Velkhover-Chizhevsky phenomenon in the relationship between vertical solar-terrestrial connections. The correlation between geomagnetic index Ap and total ozone content suggests that changes in solar radiation can influence atmospheric circulation patterns, which may have implications for disease incidence rates. The inconsistent relationship between COVID-19 incidence rates and geomagnetic index Ap during the two waves of the pandemic highlights the complexity of these relationships.
