Here is a summary of the study in one detailed paragraph, focusing on ozone-related information and data:

This study investigates urban ozone formation and sensitivities to volatile chemical products (VCPs), cooking emissions, and nitrogen oxides (NOx) across the Los Angeles Basin during summer 2021. The authors used a Lagrangian box model to simulate ozone response to sector-specific VOC and NOx emissions from the FIVE-VCP-NEI17NRT inventory. Results show that anthropogenic VOCs enhance daily maximum 8-hour average ozone in Pasadena by 12 ppb, with VCPs contributing 44%, cooking emissions 28%, and fossil fuel VOCs 28%. Biogenic VOCs contribute an additional 8 ppb. The study also finds that NOx sensitivity analyses indicate the photochemical regime of ozone varies spatially and temporally, transitioning from NOx-saturated to NOx-limited chemistry during peak ozone production in Pasadena.
