Here are the five detailed paragraphs based on the scientific study:

**Paragraph 1**
The administration of anesthesia by inhalation is a crucial aspect of modern medicine, with an increasing number of surgeries requiring general anesthesia. However, the environmental impact of these gases has been largely overlooked until recently. The greenhouse gas emissions generated by volatile anesthetics are estimated to be around 10% of total emissions in the health sector. This audit aims to investigate the toxicity of anaesthetic gases in operating rooms and highlight the need for sustainable practices.

**Paragraph 2**
The methods used in this study involve a thorough review of existing literature on the environmental impact of anaesthetic gases. The Global Warming Potential (GWP) was calculated using various models, including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) guidelines. The anesthetic gases studied included desflurane and sevoflurane, which are commonly used in clinical settings. The study also examined the methods used for waste gas scavenging and air conditioning systems.

**Paragraph 3**
The results of this study indicate that anaesthetic gases have a significant impact on the environment. Desflurane has a high GWP, while sevoflurane has a lower GWP. However, both gases are still significant contributors to greenhouse gas emissions. The study also found that waste gas scavenging systems and air conditioning methods can significantly reduce emissions.

**Paragraph 4**
The discussion of this study highlights the need for sustainable practices in anesthesia. The use of desflurane should be minimized, while sevoflurane may be a more suitable alternative. Waste gas scavenging systems and air conditioning methods should also be implemented to reduce emissions. Furthermore, education and training are essential for healthcare professionals to understand the environmental impact of anaesthetic gases.

**Paragraph 5**
In conclusion, this study demonstrates the significant environmental impact of anaesthetic gases in operating rooms. The results highlight the need for sustainable practices and alternatives that minimize greenhouse gas emissions. Healthcare professionals must take responsibility for reducing their carbon footprint by adopting environmentally friendly methods and technologies. By working together, we can reduce the environmental burden of anesthesia and contribute to a more sustainable future.
