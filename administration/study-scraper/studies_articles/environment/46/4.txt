In conclusion, this study highlights the importance of combining experimental and theoretical approaches to understand the complex mechanisms governing atmospheric chemistry. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of using the PFR model, CHEMKIN Pro software, Gaussian 16, and ChemRate software in modeling the oxidation mechanism of the earth's atmosphere. These findings have important implications for improving our understanding of atmospheric chemistry and its role in environmental issues, and can inform future research in this area.
