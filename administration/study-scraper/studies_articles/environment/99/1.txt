To achieve our objectives, we used a statistical method to analyze the relationship between geomagnetic index Ap, total ozone content, and the incidence of COVID-19 worldwide for the period from January 1, 2020 to May 1, 2021. We also analyzed the occurrence of sudden stratospheric warmings during 11 solar cycles using a statistical method. Our dataset included daily values of geomagnetic index Ap, total ozone content, and COVID-19 incidence rates.
