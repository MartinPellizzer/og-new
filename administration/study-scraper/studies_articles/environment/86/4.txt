Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the complex relationships between air pollutants and various factors. The findings highlight the importance of considering both natural processes and anthropogenic sources when examining pollutant concentrations. Further research is needed to better understand the underlying mechanisms driving these correlations and to identify effective strategies for reducing air pollution in metropolitan regions. By addressing air pollution, we can improve public health and ecosystem services, ultimately contributing to a more sustainable future.
