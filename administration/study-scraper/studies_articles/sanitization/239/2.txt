The results show that UV-O3 exposure leads to significant changes in the optical and electrical properties of suspended and flat 2D TMDCs. Raman spectroscopy revealed the formation of defects on the crystal surface, while atomic force microscopy showed a decrease in surface roughness. Electrical conductivity measurements demonstrated a significant increase in carrier mobility after UV-O3 exposure. These findings suggest that UV-O3 exposure can be used to tailor the optical and electrical properties of TMDCs.
