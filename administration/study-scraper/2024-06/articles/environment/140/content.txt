Here are five detailed paragraphs using the information and data from the scientific study:

**Paragraph 1**
Comprehensive volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emission control is imperative to decreasing occupational health risks and environmental impact of the packaging and printing industries. The sources of VOCs in the atmosphere include both natural and anthropogenic sources, with anthropogenic sources coming from traffic emissions, industrial sources, landfill emissions, and volatile chemical products (VCPs). The printing industry predominantly utilizes VCPs as primary and ancillary materials, resulting in the substantial release of VOCs into the atmosphere.

**Paragraph 2**
The methods used in this study included field measurements to establish the VOCs characteristic composition spectrum on 10 representative packaging and printing companies in Shandong Province. The variations in VOCs emissions were investigated and compared for three types of packaging and printing industries, including metal, plastic, and paper packaging. We identified VOCs compounds and their concentrations and compared these factors across the three types of packaging industries.

**Paragraph 3**
The results showed that plastic packaging enterprises had the greatest levels of unorganized VOCs emissions, consisting predominantly of oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs), followed by alkanes and halocarbons. From metal and paper packaging enterprises, OVOCs, alkanes, and aromatics were significant components of unorganized VOCs emissions. Aromatics, halocarbons, and OVOCs contributed significantly to ozone formation potential in workshops.

**Paragraph 4**
The discussion highlights the importance of evaluating VOCs emissions from packaging and printing industries, particularly in Shandong Province. The results indicate that plastic packaging enterprises have the highest levels of unorganized VOCs emissions, while metal and paper packaging enterprises also emit significant amounts of VOCs. The potential carcinogenic risk associated with VOCs in the packaging and printing industries was not significant, but non-carcinogenic risks were elevated due to exposure to ethyl acetate, isopropanol, acrolein, 1,1,2-Trichloroethane, 1,2-Dichloropropane, and naphthalene.

**Paragraph 5**
The conclusions of this study emphasize the need for comprehensive VOCs emission control in packaging and printing industries to decrease occupational health risks and environmental impact. The results provide valuable data for regional VOCs pollution control and occupational health risk assessments. Additionally, the findings highlight the importance of considering endocrine-disrupting properties and genetic toxic effects caused by benzene, toluene, styrene, and naphthalene. Overall, this study demonstrates the significance of evaluating VOCs emissions from packaging and printing industries in Shandong Province.
