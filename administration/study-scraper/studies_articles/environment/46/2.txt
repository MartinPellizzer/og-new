The results of this study showed that the PFR model accurately predicted the reaction rates and product distributions for the oxidation mechanism of the earth's atmosphere. The kinetic processes modeled using Gaussian 16 and ChemRate software also revealed insights into the mechanisms governing these reactions. These findings provide a valuable basis for understanding the complex interactions occurring in atmospheric chemistry.
