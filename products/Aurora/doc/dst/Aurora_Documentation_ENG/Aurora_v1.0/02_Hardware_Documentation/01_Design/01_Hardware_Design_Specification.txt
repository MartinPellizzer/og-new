## 7. Environmental Requirements

This section defines the environmental conditions under which Aurora is designed to operate reliably and safely. Adherence to these requirements is critical for maintaining performance, longevity, and safety of both hardware and electronics. All specified limits are based on industrial standards for electronic and ozone-generating equipment.

### 7.1 Operating Temperature and Humidity
- **Operating Temperature Range:** 0°C to 45°C (32°F to 113°F)  
  The system must maintain full functional performance within this temperature range without degradation of components, sensors, or control electronics.

  Condensation inside the enclosure can damage PCBs, sensors, and actuators. Humidity beyond this range requires dehumidification or environmental control.  
- **Temperature Gradient Tolerance:** Maximum 5°C/hour  
  Rapid temperature changes should not induce thermal stress on mechanical or electronic components.  
- **Derating Requirements:**  
  - At temperatures above 40°C, ozone generation efficiency may decrease; system software will adjust output accordingly.  
  - Active cooling or forced ventilation is recommended for sustained operation near the upper temperature limit.

### 7.2 Storage Conditions
- **Storage Temperature Range:** -20°C to 60°C (-4°F to 140°F)  
  Protects electronics, sensors, and ozone-generating components from thermal stress during transport and storage.  
- **Storage Humidity:** 10% to 90% non-condensing  
  Moisture exposure during storage can degrade sensor calibration and promote corrosion of metallic components.  
- **Packaging Considerations:**  
  - Storage in anti-static bags for PCB assemblies.  
  - Enclosures should be sealed to prevent dust ingress and moisture condensation.  
- **Shelf Life:** 12 months recommended before recalibration and pre-use verification.

### 7.3 Shock and Vibration
- **Shock Tolerance:**  
  - 10g peak, 11ms half-sine pulse in all axes for transport and handling.  
  - Internal components should be secured with fasteners, padding, or vibration-damping mounts.  
- **Vibration Tolerance:**  
  - 5–500 Hz, 1.0g RMS sinusoidal or random vibration for operational use.  
  - PCB and actuator mounts must incorporate vibration damping to prevent connector loosening or mechanical fatigue.  
- **Testing Recommendations:**  
  - Perform pre-shipment vibration testing to confirm mechanical integrity and sensor stability.

### 7.4 Ingress Protection (IP Rating)
- **Target IP Rating:** IP54 (dust protected, splash-proof)  
  - Protects electronics and ozone generator from dust accumulation and water splashes in typical industrial environments.  
- **Enclosure Requirements:**  
  - Sealed gaskets at all access panels.  
  - Cable entry points must use IP-rated glands or seals.  
- **Periodic Inspection:**  
  - Check seals and gaskets for wear or damage every 6–12 months.  
  - Clean ventilation filters to maintain airflow without compromising IP rating.

### 7.5 Altitude and Atmospheric Considerations
- **Operating Altitude:** 0–2000 meters (0–6560 feet) above sea level  
  - Above 2000 meters, ozone generation efficiency may decrease due to reduced air density; software adjustments or flow modifications may be required.  
- **Storage Altitude:** 0–3000 meters (0–9840 feet)  
- **Atmospheric Pressure Tolerance:** 80–110 kPa (0.8–1.1 atm)  
  - Equipment must maintain safe electrical insulation and ozone generation within this pressure range.  
- **Air Quality Considerations:**  
  - Avoid environments with excessive dust, corrosive gases, or chemical vapors that could degrade sensors, electronics, or ozone generation components.  

**Notes:** All environmental parameters should be verified during the hardware qualification phase. Deviations from these requirements may affect system safety, ozone output, and electronic reliability.
