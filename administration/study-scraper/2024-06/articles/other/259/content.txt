Here are the five detailed paragraphs based on the scientific study:

**Paragraph 1**
The airway proteolytic environment is a complex and dynamic system that plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of various respiratory diseases. Imbalance of airway proteases and antiproteases has been implicated in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and environmental exposures such as cigarette smoke and ozone. Respiratory viruses, including influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), have been shown to hijack endogenous proteases to initiate infection. Understanding the proteolytic environment of the airway epithelium is essential for developing effective therapeutic strategies.

**Paragraph 2**
To investigate the profile of extracellular proteases and antiproteases in human airway samples, we used mass-spectrometry-based proteomics to analyze the apical wash of cultured human nasal epithelial cells (HNECs) and nasal epithelial lining fluid (NELF) samples from healthy human subjects. We also developed an optimized method for probing the proteolytic environment of airway surface liquid samples using fluorogenic peptides modeling the cleavage sites of respiratory viruses.

**Paragraph 3**
Our results showed that we detected 48 proteases in the apical wash of cultured HNECs and 57 in NELF samples, as well as 29 and 48 antiproteases in the HNEC apical washes and NELF, respectively. We observed large interindividual variability in the rate of cleavage of an influenza H1 peptide in ex vivo clinical samples. Notably, we found a statistically significant increase in proteolysis of Influenza H1 in nasal lavage samples from male smokers compared to female smokers.

**Paragraph 4**
These findings suggest that the airway proteolytic environment is complex and influenced by various factors, including gender and smoking status. The ability to measure proteolytic activation of influenza HA using human airway surface liquid samples provides a valuable tool for assessing therapeutic treatment or exposure to respiratory viruses. Our method may also be useful for evaluating the antiprotease activity in airway samples from patients with chronic lung diseases.

**Paragraph 5**
In conclusion, this study demonstrates the importance of understanding the airway proteolytic environment and its impact on respiratory disease pathogenesis. The optimized method developed in this study can be used to assess proteolytic activation of influenza HA and other respiratory viruses in human airway samples, which may have significant implications for the development of therapeutic strategies against these diseases. Further studies are needed to fully elucidate the role of airway proteases and antiproteases in respiratory disease pathogenesis and to develop effective treatments for these diseases.
