Here is a summarized paragraph about ozone in the study:

The study employed ozone produced by a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma generator as an oxidant in the oxidation process for heavy naphtha desulfurization. The results showed that the maximum sulfur removal efficiency of 91% was achieved at a temperature of 50Â°C, flow rate of 75 ml/min, and time of 4 hours when using ozone generated via the DBD plasma reactor. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of non-thermal plasma technology in desulfurizing heavy naphtha fuel, highlighting its potential as an alternative to traditional methods.
