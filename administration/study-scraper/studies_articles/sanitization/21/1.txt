To address this challenge, a robot germicidal system was designed with a sustainable ozone control system. The robot is equipped with six UVC cylindrical lamps that emit ultraviolet radiation at a wavelength of 253.7 nanometers. The system is remotely controlled and has an autonomous mode for optimal disinfection.
