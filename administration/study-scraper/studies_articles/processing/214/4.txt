In conclusion, this study demonstrates that direct and indirect pre-oxidation using ozone gas can improve gold recovery from sulfide-type refractory ores. The optimal conditions for pre-oxidation were found to be at pH 2, using pure O2 as the ozone raw material. These findings have important implications for the development of more effective methods for processing refractory gold ores and increasing gold extraction yields in the cyanidation process.
