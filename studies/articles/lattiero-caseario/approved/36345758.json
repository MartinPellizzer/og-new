    "abstract": "Although ozone shows antimicrobial activity against mastitis-causing pathogens in ruminants, its anti-inflammatory effect on mammary glands remains unclear. The aim of this study was to examine the anti-inflammatory effects of ozonized glycerin (OG) on experimentally induced inflammation in the mammary glands of six Shiba and two Tokara lactating goats. We infused 1\u2009\u03bcg lipopolysaccharide (LPS) into all udders on day -1. On day 0, post LPS infusion, OG (ozone group), and glycerin (control group) were infused into the right and left sides of the udders, respectively. Milk samples were collected once daily from days -1 to 7. The somatic cell count and lactoperoxidase (LPO) activity, along with the interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, IL-8, IL-10, lactoferrin, and sodium ion concentrations in milk were measured. IL-8, IL-10, and lactoferrin levels after LPS infusion in the ozone group were significantly lower than those in the control group, and the LPO activity tended to be lower than that observed in the control group. This study showed that OG has anti-inflammatory potential against LPS-induced inflammation in the mammary glands."
