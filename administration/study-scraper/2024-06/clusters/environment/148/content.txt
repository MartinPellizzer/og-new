Abstract
Ozone pollution is formed through complex chemical and physical processes closely associated with emissions, photochemical reactions, and meteorological conditions. The objective of this study is to quantify the contributions of meteorological chemical formation, vertical transport, and horizontal transport to air quality during spring and summer in different regions of the Sichuan Basin. The Community Multi-scale Air Quality (CMAQ) with the Integrated Process Rate (IPR) was employed to simulate the months of April and July 2021 in the Sichuan Basin. The results indicate that both the spring and summer chemical formation of ozone in the urban centre show negative values, while the surrounding urban areas contribute positively, with chemical formation ranging from 0 to 10 μg·m−3. The maximum ozone level due to horizontal transport in the urban centre exceeds 20 μg·m−3, whereas horizontal transport in the surrounding urban areas exhibits negative values, with transport contributions concentrated within the range of −5 to 0 μg·m−3. The vertical transport in the central and southern parts of the basin shows positive values, with transport contributions ranging from 0 to 10 μg·m−3, and the urban centre exhibits relatively stronger vertical transport with contributions ranging from 10 to 20 μg·m−3. Although the chemical formation contribution in the urban centre is relatively small due to high nitrogen oxide emissions, vertical and horizontal transport play significant roles and are among the key factors contributing to ozone pollution formation.
