The study's findings suggest that controlling complex industrial and port activities, as well as reducing emissions of hydrogen sulfide, benzene, sulfur dioxide, and PM10, can mitigate the negative effects of air pollution on public health. The results also highlight the importance of considering the interrelationships between variables in assessing air pollution risk. Furthermore, the study's methodology provides a useful tool for policymakers and healthcare professionals to develop effective strategies for reducing air pollution-related health risks.
