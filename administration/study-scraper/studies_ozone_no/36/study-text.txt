Abstract
Long-term mortality effects of particulate air pollution have been investigated in a causal analytic frame, while causal evidence for associations with gaseous air pollutants remains extensively lacking, especially for carbon monoxide (CO) and sulfur dioxide (SO2). In this study, we estimated the causal relationship of long-term exposure to nitrogen dioxide (NO2), CO, SO2, and ozone (O3) with mortality. Utilizing the data from National Morbidity, Mortality, and Air Pollution Study, we applied a variant of difference-in-differences (DID) method with conditional Poisson regression and generalized weighted quantile sum regression (gWQS) to investigate the independent and joint effects. Independent exposures to NO2, CO, and SO2 were causally associated with increased risks of total, nonaccidental, and cardiovascular mortality, while no evident associations with O3 were identified in the entire population. In gWQS analyses, an interquartile range-equivalent increase in mixture exposure was associated with a relative risk of 1.067 (95% confidence interval: 1.010–1.126) for total mortality, 1.067 (1.009–1.128) for nonaccidental mortality, and 1.125 (1.060–1.193) for cardiovascular mortality, where NO2 was identified as the most significant contributor to the overall effect. This nationwide DID analysis provided causal evidence for independent and combined effects of NO2, CO, SO2, and O3 on increased mortality risks among the US general population.

Introduction
Ambient air pollution has posed a significant and persistent threat to global public health over several decades1. The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Project estimated that in 2019, air pollution, as the 4th highest-ranking driver of mortality worldwide, caused approximately 6.67 million premature deaths per year2. A large number of population-based studies suggested the associations between prolonged air pollution exposure and heightened risk of total and cause-specific mortality, but these accumulating evidences have been dominated by modeling associations rather than establishing causality3. Some scientists advocated for a shift in focus when updating and revising air quality standards, emphasizing the importance of the evidence from causal inference methods rather than relying largely on that of traditional association analysis particularly in cases where the causality of confounding factors was not clear4. Estimated effects of exposure from traditional association assessment models often suffered from residual biases introduced by unmeasured confounders5, but causal inference models, exemplified by the difference-in-differences (DID) approach, could be recognized as a viable approach to address this issue of residual confounding that frequently bedevils observational investigations6.
DID analysis, characterized by its quasi-experimental nature, has gradually gained prominence in the scientific field of environmental epidemiology for estimating causality. Standard DID methods could leverage the assumption of parallel trends and well allow controlling for unobserved confounders, thereby facilitating the identification of causal associations between exposures and outcomes of interest within a counterfactual framework7. Building upon this traditional framework, Wang and colleagues developed a variant of DID analysis to quantify the causal effects of particulate air pollutants on mortality through comparing annual fluctuations in mortality and exposure levels across designated geographical units8. The revised DID design could not only enhance the capacity to capture the temporal and spatial effects of environmental exposure, but also well account for the potential impacts engendered by socioeconomic factors and unobserved variables9.
Several emerging DID studies provided causal evidence linking particulate air pollution with mortality7,9,10,11, while causal effects of gaseous air pollutants remained extensively lacking12,13. Moreover, given that individuals were generally exposed to increasingly complex and ever-changing environmental mixtures, there have been surprisingly few studies examining the combined associations of prolonged air pollutants exposure with total and cardiorespiratory mortality14. To fill these research gaps, we designed a variant of DID analysis to assess the causal effects of four criteria gaseous air pollutants on mortality based on 108 municipalities in the United States (US) covering the years 1987–2000. The primary objective of this investigation was to examine the individual and joint associations between prolonged exposure to gaseous air pollutants and four mortality endpoints. A secondary objective was to explore the potential effect modifications by age in these causal associations. The investigation into age-related vulnerabilities concerning air pollution exposure could provide a valuable basis for the development of targeted public health interventions, a matter of increasing importance in an aging global population.
Methods
Data collection
The principal data for our analysis were sourced from National Morbidity, Mortality, and Air Pollution Study (NMMAPS) database, and the NMMAPS incorporated data from the US National Center for Health Statistics, the 2000 US Census, US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the National Climatic Data Centre15,16. The NMMAPS consists of daily time-series data of mortality, air pollution, and weather conditions for 108 municipalities across the continental US over the period 1987–2000 (Fig. S1). Daily counts of deaths from total and nonaccidental causes, as well as cardiovascular disease (CVD) and respiratory disease (RD) were collected from US National Center for Health Statistics and subdivided into three age categories (≤64, 65–74, ≥75 years). Additionally, total population data was sourced from the 2000 U.S. Census. Daily average concentrations of particulate (PM2.5 and PM10) and gaseous (NO2, O3, SO2, CO) pollutants were averaged across all monitoring sites within each of the metropolitan areas, provided by the US EPA, and daily meteorological data including mean temperatures and relative humidity were derived from the National Climatic Data Centre. A detailed description of the NMMAPS dataset can be found in prior publications17,18. In our analytic stage, for each year (1987–2000) and each municipality, daily time-series data of total and cause-specific deaths were aggregated into annual sums, and daily air pollutants and temperatures were summarized as annual averages and seasonal averages or deviations in summers (June to August) and winters (December to February), respectively19.
Statistical analysis
Descriptive characteristics were summarized as means (standard deviations, SDs) for continuous variables or frequencies (proportions) for categorical variables. Spearman rank correlation coefficient (rs) was used to measure the pairwise correlations among gaseous air pollutants.
DID design
A developed variant of the DID approach, a causal modeling method that could control for unmeasured confounders and capture broader temporal trends over the period 1987 to 2000, was utilized to estimate the effect of long-term exposure to each gaseous air pollutant on total and cause-specific mortality8. This modified DID analysis was primarily designed in this study through comparing year-to-year (e.g., 1988 vs. 1987, 1989 vs. 1988) changes in annual concentrations of the four gaseous air pollutants (NO2, CO, SO2, and O3) with concurrent changes in total and cause-specific (i.e., nonaccidental, CVD, RD) death number in given 108 municipality units9. Under this DID framework, some factors such as socio-economic status, demographic characteristics, and behavioral influences may vary rarely between adjacent years so their confounding effects could be counteracted. However, other time-variant factors that were associated with exposure remained to be adjusted. In accordance to recent DID studies based on aggregated times-series data9,10,20, it is hypothesized that such potential confounders might only be seasonal temperatures in our DID analysis on air pollution-mortality associations. The parallel trend assumption is key to causal estimation in DID design, which means that differences in mortality between spatial units in the absence of exposure effects remained stable over time12.
Individual analysis
We used conditional Poisson regression (CPR) model with time-varying exposure at a 1-year scale, to estimate the causal effects of prolonged individual exposure to gaseous pollutants on mortality. CPR model could be a good solution to address the issues of overdispersion and autocorrelation of time series data20. We fitted the following DID model to analyze the mortality effects of individual gaseous air pollutants, considering spatial and temporal factors, as well as seasonal variation and population-level characteristics:
$$\text{ln}\left[E\left({Y}_{s,t}\right)\right]={\beta }_{0}+{\beta }_{1}{I}_{s}+{\beta }_{2}{I}_{t}+{\beta }_{3}{Temp}_{sum}+{\beta }_{4}{Temp}_{win}+{\beta }_{5}SD({Temp}_{sum})+{\beta }_{6}SD({Temp}_{win})+{\beta }_{7}{AP}_{s,t}+\text{ln}({Pop}_{s,t})$$
where \({Y}_{s,t}\) represents the number of total and cause-specific deaths in spatial unit s (i.e., 108 US municipalities), calendar year t (14-y period, 1987–2000). \({AP}_{s,t}\) refers to the annual mean concentrations of air pollutants in spatial unit s, calendar year t. \({\text{ln}(Pop}_{s,t})\) is an offset term representing the natural logarithm of the population in spatial unit s, which controlled for the confounding effect due to city-level population variations. \({I}_{s}\) is a dummy variable for each spatial unit s.\({I}_{t}\) is a dummy variable for each calendar year t. \({\beta }_{0}\) is the fixed intercept term. \({\beta }_{1}\), \({\beta }_{2}\) are regression coefficients of the spatial and temporal effects. \({\beta }_{3},{\beta }_{4},{\beta }_{5},{\beta }_{6}\) are regression coefficients for the effects of mean summer and winter temperatures and their standard deviations, respectively. \({\beta }_{7}\) represents the independent effect of each gaseous pollutant.
The estimated associations were expressed as relative risks (RRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) per interquartile range (IQR) increase in individual exposure to gaseous air pollutant, and statistical significance was defined as P <0.05 (two-tailed). Given the potential departure of linear assumptions in modeling the relationships between independent exposure to four gaseous air pollutants and total and cause-specific mortality, a natural cubic spline (NCS) term of each pollutant with 3 degrees of freedom was incorporated into the CPR model to derive the exposure–response (E-R) association curves10. Likelihood ratio test was employed to examine the nonlinearity in associations between gaseous pollutants and mortality via comparing goodness of fit between linear and NCS smoothed models21.
Several sensitivity analyses were carried out to testify the robustness of the estimated associations. Firstly, age-stratified analysis was conducted to investigate potentially differential susceptibility to gaseous air pollutants across distinct age groups (≤64, 65–74, and ≥75 years), and meta-regression approach was adopted to examine effect heterogeneity between groups. Secondly, we re-ran the CPR models by extending exposure lag periods, from the current year (lag 0) up to previous 3 years (lag 3) and moving averages of current and previous 1–3 year’s exposure (lag 01, lag 02, and lag 03). Thirdly, bi-, tri-, and quad-pollutant models were fitted to check the influence of co-pollutant adjustments. Finally, since reliable PM2.5 monitoring did not begin until around 1999 in the US, we performed co-pollutant analyses by additionally adjusting for PM10 in the DID model given the potential confounding effect of particulate air pollution on the mortality effect of gaseous pollutants.
gWQS regression analysis
To measure the overall joint effect of NO2, CO, SO2, and O3 along with their relative contributions to the targeted mortality outcomes, we introduced the generalized weighted quantile sum regression (gWQS) by constructing a gWQS index to facilitate mixture-exposure analysis6. Pollutant exposures were classified into quartiles separately and combined into a gWQS index by determining weights according to their relevance to the overall associations with the outcome, which could thus reduce dimensionality and avoid covariance issues22. In this study, we incorporated the gWQS approach into main
