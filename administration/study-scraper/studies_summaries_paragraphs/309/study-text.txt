Here is a summary of the study in one detailed paragraph, focusing on information and data related to ozone:

The study compared bacterial community profiles of two Duckweed Production Module (DPM) systems under disinfection conditions using aqueous ozone treatment and non-disinfection conditions. The results showed that aqueous ozonation significantly altered the prevalence and relative abundance of bacterial taxa associated with duckweed tissue, indicating a disruption in bacterial tissue colonization. The colony-forming unit (CFU) analysis also demonstrated the efficiency of aqueous ozone to decrease total bacterial load. These findings suggest that ozone treatment can play a crucial role in maintaining the quality and safety of duckweed cultivation in controlled environments, such as vertical multi-layered platforms under controlled conditions.
