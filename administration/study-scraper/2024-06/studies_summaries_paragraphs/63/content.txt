Here is a summarized paragraph focusing on ozone-related information within the study:

The tearing energy threshold for carbon black reinforced natural rubber exposed to ozone was found to be a maximum of 2.12 J/mÂ², which is 96% lower than that of non-ozone-exposed specimens. This novel experimental-numerical approach combines in-situ optical analysis of ozone crack growth on the rubber surface with finite element method calculations of energy release rates at crack tips using Ansys software. Ozone, a relatively unstable molecule comprising three oxygen atoms, is present in small quantities in the atmosphere and plays a crucial role in living organisms. In the troposphere, ozone is considered a pollutant due to its strong oxidizing properties, which damage materials such as natural rubber, leading to oxidative cleavage on the surface, chain scission, and reduction in surface strength. The exposure of unsaturated rubber compounds to ozone induces cracking, making it essential to prevent this phenomenon by adding antiozonants during rubber production.
