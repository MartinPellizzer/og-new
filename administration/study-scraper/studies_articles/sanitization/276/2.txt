The results show that the level of residual ozone at 0.4 mg/L and treatment time of 4-6 minutes are sufficient to inactivate polioviruses. The authors also present equations for the kinetic model of ozone decomposition in both acidic and alkaline environments. The study demonstrates the high efficiency of ozone compared to chlorine-containing disinfectants.
