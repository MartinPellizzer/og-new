The ozonolysis reaction of alkenes is a critical process in atmospheric and combustion chemistry, as it leads to the formation of secondary organic aerosols. However, understanding the reaction mechanisms is challenging due to the difficulty in detecting key intermediates, known as Criegee intermediates (CIs). To address this knowledge gap, researchers have investigated the ozone-assisted oxidation reactions of trans-2-pentene and cyclopentene, two alkenes with different structures, using a combination of experimental and theoretical methods.
