The discharge of anthropogenic organic micro-pollutants into natural water cycles poses a significant threat to ecological water quality and the safety of drinking water resources. Municipal wastewater represents a major discharge pathway, and climate change is predicted to exacerbate this problem. Conventional wastewater treatment technology allows only partial removal of specific substances, leaving a need for advanced chemical wastewater treatment that can retain a broad spectrum of pollutants.
