In conclusion, this study demonstrates the effectiveness of magnesium oxide-based nanocatalyst in photocatalytic ozonation for removing Acid Blue 113 dye from wastewater. The optimized conditions identified in this study can be used to develop more efficient and sustainable treatment methods for industrial effluents containing acid dyes. Future studies can focus on scaling up the process and exploring its application in real-world scenarios to mitigate environmental pollution caused by acid dyes.
