    "abstract": "The food value of potatoes, cabbage and carrot was studied after their treatment with ozone to prolong their period of storage. The regimen of ozone-treatment of the vegetables under laboratory conditions was: 20-40 mg/m3/4 h/day/25 times. The ozonization regimen under production conditions was close to that under laboratory conditions. Ozone concentration for potatoes treatment was 20-25 mg/m3, cabbage 7-13 mg/m3, carrot 5-15 mg/m3. The investigation of the chemical composition of potatoes, carrot and cabbage after ozone action under production and laboratory conditions has shown that under the influence of ozone treatment the content of ascorbic acid decreased by 16 to 25%. Such parameters of food value as protein and starch in potatoes, and sugar and carotene in cabbage and carrot did not significantly change. The study of organoleptic properties of potatoes and vegetables did not reveal any changes as compared to nontreated products."
