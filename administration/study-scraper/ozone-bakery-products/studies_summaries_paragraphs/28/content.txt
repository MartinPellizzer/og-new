Here is a detailed summary of the study in one paragraph, focusing on ozone-related information:

A study published in the Journal of Food Processing and Preservation investigated the efficacy of ozonation in reducing mycotoxins and fungal contamination in artificially contaminated soft wheat grains. The researchers evaluated the effects of O3 concentration, exposure time, and grain mass on deoxynivalenol (DON), aflatoxins, and total fungal count (TFC). The results showed that ozonation with 60 mg/L O3 for 300 min and 2 kg grain samples achieved significant reductions in TFC (3.0 cycles log cfu/g) and mycotoxin levels: 64.3% in DON and 48.0% in total aflatoxins. The study found that O3 concentration and exposure time positively influenced the reduction of both mycotoxins and TFC, while grain mass had a negative effect on these variables. These findings suggest that gaseous ozonation is an effective method for remediation of fungal and mycotoxin contamination in wheat grains.
