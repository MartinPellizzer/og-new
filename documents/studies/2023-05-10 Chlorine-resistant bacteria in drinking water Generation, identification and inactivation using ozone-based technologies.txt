---------------------------------------------------

problem:
	the demand for drinking water is increasing
	usually, chlorine is used for disinfection
	organisms can still survive high chlorine concentration

experiment:
	[buy]

result:
	[buy]

objective:
	ozone can effectively destroy the CRB cell structure and damage the partial DNA

------------------------------------------------------

Highlights
	- Reasons for the emergence of CRB in drinking water networks were presented.
	- Methods and processes for the conventional inactivation of CRB were investigated.
	- Ozone could effectively destroy the CRB cell structure and damage the partial DNA.
	- Ozone-based technologies could improve the continuous ozone disinfection ability.
