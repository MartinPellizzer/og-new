**Paragraph 1**

The increasing global challenges of geopolitical and economical changes, as well as climate change, have significant impacts on European and international cities. These urban areas face pressure to enhance policies that promote sustainability and livability, while also providing environments and social fabrics that support public health (PH) and wellbeing (WB). In this study, we propose a framework that addresses the factors influencing PH and WB, with the aim of improving urban health and reducing health disparities through changes in individual behavior.

**Paragraph 2**

Our proposed framework uses technological devices to gather data from citizens, identifying factors affecting PH and WB. We collected data on heartbeat, which is defined as the most important health factor, and found that it was mostly affected by ozone (O3) and carbonate oxygen (CO). Our methods included using mHealth technologies to promote public health and wellbeing in urban areas with blue-green solutions.

**Paragraph 3**

Results from our preliminary analysis show that the heartbeat, which is defined as the most important health factor, is mostly affected by Ozone (O3) and carbonate oxygen (CO). However, most data were collected from grey areas, leaving room for improvement. Our findings suggest that environmental factors have a significant impact on public health.

**Paragraph 4**

The results of this study highlight the importance of considering environmental factors in urban planning and policy-making to promote public health and wellbeing. The framework proposed in this study provides evidence-based insights into the relationships between environmental factors, public health, and wellbeing. Future studies can build upon these findings to develop more targeted interventions.

**Paragraph 5**

In conclusion, our framework has the potential to improve urban health and reduce health disparities by identifying key factors affecting public health and wellbeing. By leveraging mHealth technologies and blue-green solutions, we can promote healthier behaviors and environments that support overall wellbeing. The study's findings also underscore the importance of considering environmental factors in urban planning and policy-making. Future studies should continue to explore the relationships between environmental factors, public health, and wellbeing to inform evidence-based interventions.
