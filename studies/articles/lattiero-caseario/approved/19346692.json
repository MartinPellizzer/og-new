    "abstract": "The objective of this field study was to determine the therapeutic efficacy of mammary irrigation for the treatment of dairy cattle diagnosed with acute coliform mastitis caused by gram-negative bacteria. Additionally, the effects of different mammary irrigation regimen fluids such as ozone water and normal saline were compared. Dairy cattle clinically diagnosed with acute coliform mastitis (n = 57) were enrolled in the study, randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups, and received the following treatments: systemic antibiotic administration (SAA group; n = 40), mammary irrigation regimen (MIR group; n = 10), and both treatments (MIX group; n=7). Significant antipyretic effects, as assessed by rectal temperature measurement, were observed in the MIX and MIR groups. Although 2 irrigating fluids were used, namely, ozone water and normal saline, no significant difference was observed between the 2 groups. Fourteen days after the onset of the treatments, the milk yield recovery rate in MIR group tended to be higher (p = 0.06) than that in the SAA group. Additionally, after 30 days of treatment, the MIR group cows demonstrated significantly higher successful recovery rates (p<0.05) than the SAA group cows. These results indicate that mammary irrigation with normal saline is an effective treatment for acute coliform mastitis in dairy cattle."
