Abstract
Life cycle environmental assessment is essential in assessing system performance for sustainable ecosystem. This study presented the ecological effect of installation of renewable energy systems in site Doomadgee of Far North Queensland. The aim is to determine the ecological footprint of a renewable system in sustaining the ecology. The findings of the study indicate wind turbines with the highest impacts on climate change (1.45E+11 kg CO2 eq), acidification potential (3.82E+08 mol H+ eq), eutrophication potential (6.56E+04 kg P eq). PEM electrolyser has the highest impact in the Ozone depletion category (24.87 kg CFC11 eq). The lowest impact arises because of PEM electrolyser in all categories except ozone depletion where the lowest contribution (0.072 kg CFC11 eq) comes from a wind turbine.
