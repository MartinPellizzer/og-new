Abstract

Short Lived Climate Forcers (SLCF) are substances with relatively short lifetime in the atmosphere. Recently, it has become an object of attention, because SLCF such as black carbon (BC), methane (CH4), tropospheric ozone (O3), and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) have a warming effect on climate, and some of them have detrimental impacts on human health and agriculture. In this study, it is necessary to provide basic data for establishing countermeasures in the agricultural sector against ozone, and the emission characteristics of ozone evaluated through various existing studies. As SLCF, the Radiative Forcing from increases in tropospheric ozone is estimated to be 0.35±0.15 Wm-2. Ozone damages photosynthesis, plant structure and function, as well as productivity. A common symptom of ozone injury is small stipple-like lesions on the leaf surface. Recently matured leaves are more susceptible than very young and old leaves. The optimum condition for ozone formation are high temperature and solar radiation, low relative humidity and wind speed. With these condition, early summer before the rainy season will be the worst time in Korea. It is important to understand the pollution level of ozone and various problems, which will be brought with climate change. It will be another element for agricultural management in the future.
