The findings highlight the importance of considering both heat stress and air pollution when assessing health impacts. The results show that mortality risk due to heat stress is compounded by air pollution, with the elderly being the most vulnerable group. The study's outcomes underscore the need for policymakers to consider these interlinked factors when developing strategies to mitigate the effects of climate change and improve public health.
