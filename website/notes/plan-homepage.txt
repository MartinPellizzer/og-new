Perfect brief. I’ll stay **strategic, structured, and sequential**, and I’ll write **only the website content labels/headings in Italian**, while **explaining everything in English** as requested.

Below is **Step 1: Homepage purpose → hierarchy → section rationale**.
No code, no implementation, no copy blocks yet—just the plan.

---

## STEP 1 — Define the Homepage’s Strategic Role (STA-aligned)

### What the homepage is **not**

* Not a sales page
* Not a keyword dump
* Not a duplicate of /applicazioni.html
* Not a generic “chi siamo + prodotti” landing page

### What the homepage **must be**

From a Semantic Topical Authority perspective, the homepage is:

> **A semantic index + credibility gateway**
> that defines the **entire topical universe of ozone**,
> and routes users (and crawlers) into **clear topic hubs**.

### Primary goals

1. **Define scope**: “We cover ozone as a technology, not just products”
2. **Signal authority**: industrial, scientific, standards-aware
3. **Expose topology**: applications, products, services, guides
4. **Enable internal linking** without cannibalization
5. **Serve mixed intent** (industrial, commercial, residential) cleanly

---

## STEP 2 — Global Information Architecture (Homepage Level)

The homepage should visually and semantically answer one question:

> *“What parts of the ozone domain does this company own?”*

### Mandatory topic hubs (top-level links)

You already have:

* `/applicazioni.html`
* `/prodotti.html`

From an STA perspective, these **must be complemented** by:

| Hub                        | Why it’s mandatory                        |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Applicazioni**           | Intent: “dove si usa” (already done)      |
| **Prodotti**               | Commercial + technical discovery          |
| **Servizi**                | Differentiates manufacturer vs integrator |
| **Guida all’Ozono**        | Authority, education, E-E-A-T             |
| **Blog / Approfondimenti** | Freshness, long-tail capture              |
| **Contatti**               | Trust & conversion, not salesy            |

These should all be **exposed on the homepage**, not hidden only in nav.

---

## STEP 3 — Homepage Section Stack (Top → Bottom)

Below is the **recommended section order**, with **Italian section titles only**, and the **reasoning in English**.

---

### 1. Hero / Above the Fold

**Section label (Italian):**
**Tecnologie a ozono per aria, acqua e superfici**

**Purpose**

* Define the *domain*, not the offer
* Immediately communicate industrial + scientific credibility
* Avoid marketing language (“soluzioni innovative”, “leader di mercato”)

**Why this works for STA**

* Establishes **topical breadth** (aria, acqua, superfici)
* Avoids narrowing into products too early
* Supports multiple user intents

**CTA logic**

* Primary: *Esplora le applicazioni* → `/applicazioni.html`
* Secondary: *Guida all’ozono* → `/guida-ozono/` (future hub)

---

### 2. Authority & Scope Definition

**Section label:**
**Competenza scientifica sull’ozono**

**Purpose**

* Answer: *“Why should I trust this site?”*
* Position company as **manufacturer + solutions provider**
* Introduce standards, safety, engineering mindset (without details yet)

**Content focus (high level)**

* Ozone as a technology
* Controlled generation
* Regulatory awareness
* Industrial design approach

**STA role**

* Reinforces **E-E-A-T**
* Sets tone for Guides and Services hubs

---

### 3. Topic Gateway: Applicazioni

**Section label:**
**Ambiti di applicazione dell’ozono**

**Purpose**

* Preview the existing long-form hub
* Do NOT repeat its content
* Act as a semantic gateway

**Structure idea (no implementation yet)**

* Short intro (what “applications” means)
* 4–6 high-level domains (e.g. aria, acqua, alimentare, sanitario, industriale)

**CTA**

* *Vai a tutte le applicazioni* → `/applicazioni.html`

**Why this matters**

* Clear internal link funnel
* Prevents homepage from competing with the hub
* Supports future leaf expansion

---

### 4. Topic Gateway: Prodotti

**Section label:**
**Generatori e sistemi a ozono**

**Purpose**

* Signal that products exist
* Avoid turning homepage into a catalog
* Frame products as **systems**, not SKUs

**Content positioning**

* Categories, not models
* Industrial vs commercial vs residenziale (if applicable)

**CTA**

* *Scopri i prodotti* → `/prodotti.html`

**STA benefit**

* Keeps commercial intent siloed
* Supports clean product taxonomy later

---

### 5. Topic Gateway: Servizi

**Section label:**
**Progettazione, integrazione e supporto**

**Purpose**

* Distinguish you from “hardware-only” competitors
* Speak to B2B decision-makers

**Typical service buckets**

* Progettazione impianti
* Integrazione sistemi
* Assistenza e manutenzione
* Consulenza applicativa

**CTA**

* *I nostri servizi* → `/servizi.html`

---

### 6. Educational Pillar

**Section label:**
**Guida completa all’ozono**

**Purpose**

* Anchor topical authority
* Capture informational intent
* Support long-term SEO growth

**Content role**

* Safety
* Chemistry basics
* Regulations
* Best practices
* Myths & limits

**CTA**

* *Consulta la guida all’ozono* → `/guida-ozono/`

**Why this is critical**

* This is your **authority engine**
* Separates you from purely commercial competitors

---

### 7. Trust & Proof (Non-Marketing)

**Section label:**
**Affidabilità industriale**

**Purpose**

* Reinforce seriousness without testimonials fluff
* Optional but recommended

**Possible elements**

* Years of experience
* Compliance references
* Industrial sectors served
* Certifications (if applicable)

**STA role**

* Supports conversion *indirectly*
* Reinforces expertise signals

---

### 8. Soft Conversion / Contact

**Section label:**
**Contatto tecnico**

**Purpose**

* Enable action without pressure
* Especially for engineers, buyers, consultants

**Tone**

* “Parla con un tecnico”
* “Valuta un’applicazione specifica”

**CTA**

* *Contattaci* → `/contatti.html`

---

## STEP 4 — Semantic Principles (No Code Yet)

At a high level, the homepage should follow:

* **One `<h1>` only** → domain definition
* Section titles as `<h2>`
* No product or application `<h3>` overload
* Each section = **one intent**
* Every CTA points to a **hub**, not a leaf

---

## STEP 5 — What We’ll Do Next (Future Prompts)

When you’re ready, next steps can be:

1. Define **exact Italian microcopy** for each section
2. Map **internal linking rules** (homepage → hubs → leaves)
3. Design **semantic section outlines** (headings only)
4. Only then: **HTML structure**

Just tell me:
**“Execute Step X”** and we’ll go one layer deeper—clean, controlled, and scalable.
