The Î³-alumina catalyst used in this study was synthesized using a co-precipitation method and characterized by various analytical techniques, including XRD, FTIR, FESEM, EDX, and BET. The central composite design (CCD) method was employed to design the experiments and optimize the catalytic ozonation process. The operating parameters studied included inlet ozone concentration, catalyst amount, and reaction time. A total of 25 experimental runs were conducted using a random mixture of the three factors at different levels.
