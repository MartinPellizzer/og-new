The study highlights the importance of considering non-ozone pathways in understanding SOA formation. The results suggest that GUV222 light can initiate additional chemical processes, such as photolytic reactions, which are not well understood. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying these processes and their impact on indoor air quality. The study also emphasizes the need to keep GUV222 fluence rates at the lowest effective levels to minimize the formation of new particles.
