The researchers used a Long-term Ozone Trends and Uncertainties in the Stratosphere (LOTUS) Independent Linear Trend (ILT) regression model, updated to version 0.8.0, to analyze long-term changes in stratospheric ozone time series. The study focused on records from six ground-based stations: Arosa/Davos/Hohenpei√üenberg, Switzerland/Germany; Observatory de Haute Provence (OHP), France; Boulder, Colorado; Mauna Loa Observatory (MLO) and Hilo, Hawaii; and Lauder, New Zealand. The LOTUS model was also used to investigate additional dynamical proxies at five ground-based sites.
