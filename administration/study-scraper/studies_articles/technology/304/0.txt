The removal of sulfur compounds from fuel is a crucial step in improving the quality and reducing the environmental impact of fuels. The traditional methods used for desulfurization, such as hydrotreating and solvent extraction, have limitations and drawbacks. Non-thermal plasma technology has been gaining attention in recent years due to its potential to efficiently remove sulfur compounds from fuel without the need for high temperatures or pressures.
