In conclusion, this systematic review demonstrates a significant association between the consequences of climate change and asthma in adults, particularly in children. The results emphasize the importance of understanding the impact of meteorological factors and air pollution on asthmatic symptoms and severity. Future research should focus on identifying effective strategies for mitigating the effects of climate change and air pollution on asthma to improve public health outcomes.
