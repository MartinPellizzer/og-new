Abstract
Background:
While limited studies have evaluated the health impacts of thunderstorms and power outages (POs) separately, few have assessed their joint effects. We aimed to investigate the individual and joint effects of both thunderstorms and POs on respiratory diseases, to identify disparities by demographics, and to examine the modifications and mediations by meteorological factors and air pollution.
Methods:
Distributed lag nonlinear models were used to examine exposures during three periods (i.e., days with both thunderstorms and POs, thunderstorms only, and POs only) in relation to emergency department visits for respiratory diseases (2005–2018) compared to controls (no thunderstorm/no PO) in New York State (NYS) while controlling for confounders. Interactions between thunderstorms and weather factors or air pollutants on health were assessed. The disparities by demographics and seasons and the mediative effects by particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ≤2.5μm (PM2.5) and relative humidity (RH) were also evaluated.
Results:
Thunderstorms and POs were independently associated with total and six subtypes of respiratory diseases in NYS [highest risk ratio (RR) = 1.12; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.08, 1.17], but the impact was stronger when they co-occurred (highest RR = 1.44; 95% CI: 1.22, 1.70), especially during grass weed, ragweed, and tree pollen seasons. The stronger thunderstorm/PO joint effects were observed on chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, bronchitis, and asthma (lasted 0–10 d) and were higher among residents who lived in rural areas, were uninsured, were of Hispanic ethnicity, were 6–17 or over 65 years old, and during spring and summer. The number of comorbidities was significantly higher by 0.299–0.782/case. Extreme cold/heat, high RH, PM2.5, and ozone concentrations significantly modified the thunderstorm–health effect on both multiplicative and additive scales. Over 35% of the thunderstorm effects were mediated by PM2.5 and RH.
Conclusion:
Thunderstorms accompanied by POs showed the strongest respiratory effects. There were large disparities in thunderstorm–health associations by demographics. Meteorological factors and air pollution levels modified and mediated the thunderstorm–health effects. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP13237
Introduction
While the adverse health impacts of hurricanes, flooding, and wildfires have been reported, little is known about the effects of thunderstorms, especially when accompanied by power outages (POs). Due to global climate change, the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, such as thunderstorms, will continue to increase.1–3 Thunderstorm-related asthma was first reported in the early 1980s in the United Kingdom and in 1994 in London.4,5 The most severe and largest thunderstorm was reported in 2016 in Melbourne, Australia, which experienced an unprecedented 992% increase of asthma emergency department (ED) visits (over 8,500 patients with severe asthma attacks, 35 patients in intensive care, and 10 deaths).6–9 Additionally, several studies have documented higher risks of ED visits for asthma after thunderstorms in the US states of Georgia,10 Louisiana,9 and Minnesota.11 Zou et al.2 reported that thunderstorms in the US were associated with more ED visits for Medicare beneficiaries with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Thunderstorms have become a persistent and global public health threat. This is especially true in New York State (NYS) where nearly one-third (30.18%) of all severe weather events in the last 20 years were thunderstorms.12
Additionally, thunderstorms can cause POs and lead to adverse public health impacts. A historically large group of fast-moving severe thunderstorms, or derecho, traveled from the Ohio Valley to Washington DC in 2012, killing 45 people (over half due to trees falling or property damage) and leaving 4 million individuals without power for a week.13 More frequent storms have occurred in recent decades. For instance, a derecho in 2020 traveled 1,000 mi from South Dakota to Ohio, spawned 26 tornadoes across several states, led to 1.9 million customers losing power, and caused over $11 billion in damages.14 In the summer of 2022, two enormous storm systems affected 150 million people in the US and led to over 300,000 people without power.15 Since POs are another important environmental hazard caused by severe storms and have been doubling in the past decade,16 multiple studies have also reported the negative effects of POs alone on mortality and morbidity (COPD and respiratory admissions).17–21 In addition, POs could mediate the storm–health relationship.22 Several studies have also found the highest negative health impacts of POs coupled with winter storms,23,24 windstorms,25 and flooding or hurricanes26,27 rather than thunderstorms.
While limited studies have evaluated the distinct health impacts of thunderstorms or PO, no studies have assessed the joint effects of these two events. There is also a lack of studies determining the different lag-day effects, the modifying or mediating effects of weather factors and air pollution levels, and the disparate impact by sociodemographic characteristics. In addition, little research has estimated the impact of thunderstorms and POs on comorbidities, the threshold of thunderstorms/POs for health effects, and different subtypes of respiratory diseases in addition to asthma. Furthermore, how thunderstorms change the environment, thereby indirectly affecting health, is unknown. This study aims to fill multiple knowledge gaps by a) investigating the individual and joint effects of thunderstorms and POs on ED visits and comorbidity for total and subtypes of respiratory diseases; b) comparing thunderstorm–health associations across different lag days and different levels of PO coverage; c) examining the modifying and mediating effects of weather factors and air pollutants on the thunderstorm–health relationship; and d) assessing disparities in the thunderstorm/PO–health associations by demographics, urbanicity, and seasonal patterns.
Methods
Study Design
We used distributed lag nonlinear models (DLNM) to assess the association of thunderstorms and POs on all respiratory diseases at the power operating division level in NYS, from 2005 to 2018. The average population of each power district is 19,094, and the average area is 72.26 km2. The DLNM was used because environmental stressors or exposures often show effects that are delayed in time, and the exposure–response relationship could be nonlinear. For each power operating division, we conducted DLNM analysis by including an indicator of days based on PO occurrence and thunderstorm events. Specifically, we compared the respiratory outcomes during three exposure periods (i.e., days with both thunderstorms and POs, days with thunderstorms only, and days with POs only) to the control days (i.e., neither thunderstorm nor PO) during the same season in the same division. Since the exposure–health associations were evaluated within the same small geographic area during different periods (but in the same season), the impacts of population structure, division size, sociodemographic, and slowly time-varying exposures should have been automatically controlled due to the self-comparison. Furthermore, the estimations were pooled at the operating division level to create an overall rate ratio (RR) across the state with a univariate fixed-effect meta-analysis. This study was approved by the institutional review board at the University at Albany, State University of New York (17X189) and the Data Protection Board of NYS Department of Health (NYSDOH) (1509-01 S) for individual data access, with waived patient consent. Patient consent was obtained by NYSDOH when collecting the data.
Health Data and Outcome Definitions
ED data for respiratory diseases were obtained in May 2021 from the NYSDOH Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS), which is a legislatively mandated dataset that covers 95% of hospitals in NYS. Data reported by hospitals undergo thorough review by SPARCS administrative staff to ensure accuracy and completeness. Our ED visits encompass all patients who visited the outpatient department of hospitals and those who initially came to the emergency department and subsequently became inpatients. We collected and regrouped individual information for each patient from medical charts collected by SPARCS, NYSDOH from 2005 to 2018, including gender (male, female, undetermined), race (White, Black, Asian, and others from the original 16 categories), ethnicity (Hispanic, non-Hispanic from the original seven categories), age (≤5, 6–17, 18–44, 45–64, ≥65 years old), health insurance (self-paid, Medicare, Medicaid, company insurance, others), International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code for a principal diagnosis and up to 24 other diagnoses (comorbidity), time of admission, admission and discharge date, total medical cost (USD), and residential address at street level. The categorical variables of demographic variables defined above were used in the stratified analysis to test for heterogeneity.
SPARCS originally collected 16 categories for race, including Guamanian or Chamorro, Samoan, Japanese, Vietnamese, Filipino, Native Hawaiian, Korean, Chinese, multiple races reported, other Pacific Islander, Asian Indian, Native American, other Asian, other race, Black, and White. There were also seven groups of ethnicities originally reported by the SPARCS, such as multiple ethnicities reported, Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, unknown, other Spanish origin, and non-Hispanic. We collapsed multiple race/ethnicity categories for “Asian,” “others” and “Hispanic” in our analysis to follow the standard methods used in prior studies25,27 and to increase study power by combining smaller race/ethnicity groups to increase case numbers in each category.
Each case’s residential address was geocoded to get the longitude and latitude and assigned to one of the power operating divisions. Then, the health outcomes were estimated as the sums of the daily number of ED visits at the power operating division level. We included ED visits due to the following principal diagnoses (i.e., clinically confirmed discharged diagnosis but not first/admitting diagnosis or other diagnosis): all respiratory diseases (J00–J99), COPD (J44), asthma (J45), bronchitis (J209, J120, J40, J410, J411, J90), respiratory allergy diseases (J00, J0100–J0130, J0190, J029, J0390, J040, J050, J0510, J06, J330, J310, J320–J323, J329, J301, J305, J3089, J309), respiratory infections (influenza: J09, J09.X1, J09.X2, J10.0, J10.00, J10.01, J10.08, J10.1, J11.0, J11.00, J11.08, J11.1; bacterial pneumonia: J14–J16; culture-negative pneumonia: J18), and other respiratory diseases, which were identified by using ICD-10 codes (and corresponding ICD-9 codes).
Data Source and Definitions of Thunderstorm, PO, Weather Factors, and Air Pollution
Thunderstorm data from 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2018 was obtained from the Storm Events Database (https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/) maintained by the National Weather Service of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The Storm Events Database serves as the most comprehensive dataset in the US for various weather hazards, compiles reported incidents from diverse sources, includes all domestic severe and major weather events and has been used in multiple published studies.24,25,28 Specifically, storms and other significant weather phenomena with sufficient intensity to cause loss of life, injuries, significant property damage, and/or disruption to commerce are documented in this database, as well as rare, unusual weather phenomena that garnered media attention and other significant meteorological events. It contains the dates of events, locations, and different types of weather events. We define events mentioning the terminology “Thunderstorm” or “Lightning” as “Thunderstorm.” By using the event starting coordinates as the center and total expansion distances as the diameter, we were able to determine the event effect area/buffer. Then, we determined the corresponding power operating division for which each weather event would be responsible.27
PO data (1 January 2005 to 31 December 2018) was acquired from the NYS Department of Public Service (https://www.dps.ny.gov/) in July 2021. This database includes the total number of customers in each power operating division, the date of each PO, and the number of customers affected by each PO. We calculated the PO coverage as the percent of consumers affected for each division on each day and defined the number of division days for thunderstorms or POs as the number of days of the relevant event in a specific division. The 75th percentile of PO coverage was chosen as the threshold to define a PO event among all the division days when POs occurred. This threshold was used, as it captured the upper end of the data distribution, aligned with previous studies on PO.20,25,27 When the PO coverage exceeded this threshold in prior studies, there was a statistically significant high risk on ED visits for respiratory diseases.27 To test the dose–response relationship in our own data, we compared the respiratory effects of multiple thresholds of PO coverage including 25%, 50%, and 75%.
Particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ≤2.5μm (PM2.5) and O3 were obtained from the community multiscale air quality (CMAQ) modeling system of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and chemical transport model, which have been widely used in over 150 prior studies.29 These data were downloaded in 2021 for the period of 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2018. CMAQ data represent a comprehensive numerical air quality model encompassing a wide range of resources including emissions, pollutant transport, chemical reactions, and deposition mechanisms. Temperature (°C) and relative humidity (RH) (%) were obtained from the integrated surface database (ISD) of NOAA (2005–2018). We matched event data, weather, air pollution data, and ED visits (at street level) to the nearest or overlapping power operating division based on the calculated distances between the coordinates of their monitoring sites (longitude and latitude) and division centroids. This provided unique daily PM2.5 (μg/m3), O3 (ppb), temperature, and RH metrics for each division. These factors were treated as continuous variables in the main analysis but were converted to dichotomous variables when estimating their modifying effects based on the literature.30 To identify the best indicators and examine the result consistency, we used multiple indicators, i.e., defined temperature ≥90th, ≥95th, ≥97.5th, and ≥99th percentile as extreme heat; temperature ≤10th, ≤5th, and ≤1st percentile as extreme cold31–33; high RH as RH ≥90th, ≥95th, and ≥99th percentile; and high PM2.5 and O3 at ≥50th, ≥75th, and ≥90th percentiles.34,35 We selected the 10th–90th percentile range of temperatures as the reference group when assessing the impact of extreme heat and extreme cold.
Statistical Analysis and Potential Confounders
Statistical analysis.
We used DLNM (dlnm package in R version 4.2.1 was applied) with 0–10 lag days to assess the single-day lag and multi-day lag impacts36 of thunderstorms and POs on ED visits for multiple respiratory diseases. We choose 0–10 lag days based on prior literature and trends of the health risk in similar studies.37,38 Joint occurrence of thunderstorm and PO (joint thunderstorm/PO) was defined as those power districts having a high proportion of outages and thunderstorm co-occurrence. The specification of our DLNM model is as follows: Log(ED visits) ∼ cb(thunderstorms & POs) + O3 + PM2.5 + ns(temperature) + ns(RH) + holiday + day of week + ns(time) + ns(day of the year), where cb indicates cross basis and ns indicates natural splines.
A quasi-Poisson model was employed due to overdispersion in the ED visits variable, where its distribution violates the equal mean and variance assumption under the standard Poisson model.24,25 Cb(thunderstorms & POs) denoted a cross-basis for the interaction of two indicators identifying thunderstorms and POs occurrence, respectively, with 3 degrees of freedom (df) for lag 0–10 d. Confounders in this analysis included temperature (splines with 3 df to fit the nonlinear effects), O3 (splines are not included because of its linear association with health), time-varying variables (holiday and day of week), and long-term trends (time and day of the year, both splines with 4 df). To check the collinearity among meteorological factors and air pollutants, we tested the pairwise Spearman correlation coefficients among temperature, RH, PM2.5, O3, and thunderstorms and found all pairwise correlation coefficients are 1%–41%. We selected these degrees of freedom based on Akaike information criterion for model fitness and previous studies.25,27 All analyses were conducted in R version 4.2.1.
Potential mediation effects.
As thunderstorms typically include rain or increased RH in the Northeast US region, which usually increases pollen or fine particle (e.g., PM2.5) concentrations in ambient air,9 we tried to understand the relationships between thunderstorms and air pollution or RH on health. Specifically, we evaluated the mediation effects of PM2.5 and RH on thunderstorm–health association. We performed this analysis using the single-level Granger mediation method.22 If these two variables are mediators or in the pathway of the thunderstorm–health relationship, we should not treat them as confounders.
Pollen season impacts.
Pollen counts may also be a mediator in the thunderstorm–health relationship. Although we did not have pollen data, we examined the thunderstorm–health association in three pollen seasons, including grass pollen-dominated season (June–July), ragweed season (August, September, October), and tree pollen season (April and May) by comparing to no-pollen season (November–March).39,40 We also assessed the thunderstorm–health effects during cool-viral season (October–May).
Controlling potential confounders and effect modification.
We originally considered temperature, RH, PM2.5, and O3 as potential confounders (if they were not mediators) as well as time varying variables in this study. These variables were selected due to the following reasons: a) Meteorological factors and air pollutants have been controlled in prior published studies assessing thunderstorm–asthma associations9,11; b) Based on the definition of a confounder, these factors are well-known risk factors of respiratory diseases according to the literature41,42 and NYS data,43–46 and we also found that thunderstorm days were statistically associated with higher pollution levels or extreme higher or lower temperature; c) We considered whether RR significantly changed pre-/post removing these variables from stepwise models. Specifically, we evaluated the potential interactions on the additive and multiplicative scale between thunderstorms and meteorological factors or air pollutants using five product terms, i.e., thunderstorms indicator multiplied by potential effect modifiers (dummy variables of extreme heat, extreme cold, high RH, high PM2.5, and high O3 level). To further examine the modification effects, we compared effects estimated in three different combinations (i.e., thunderstorm=1 and modifier=1; thunderstorm=1 and modifier=0; thunderstorm=0 and modifier=1) to the reference group (thunderstorm=0 and modifier=0). We used bootstrap methods to obtain indicators of additive interactions: relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI), proportion attributable to interaction (AP), and synergy index (SI).
Test of heterogeneity for demographics.
We then conducted a stratified analysis to evaluate health risk disparities by sex, age group, race, ethnicity, insurance source, season, residence of New York City (NYC) or upstate, and a six-level urban-rural classification scheme for urbanicity (large central metro, large fringe metro, medium metro, small metro, micropolitan, and noncore) using the National Center for Health Statistics at case individual level.47 We performed the tests of heterogeneity48 on different demographic strata to identify their potential effect modifications and disparities based on prior literature findings.20,25,27 Unfortunately, we were unable to conduct the interaction analysis because we did not have demographic data such as gender, race and ethnicity, etc. at the power operation division level.
How thunderstorm/PO affect comorbidities.
Furthermore, we used bootstrap resampling methods to compare the number of comorbidities between exposure (days with thunderstorms and POs) and nonexposure periods (days with neither thunderstorm nor PO). Comorbidities were determined using “other diagnoses” in the SPARCS database. In this study, we calculated the total number of comorbidities for each patient during their ED visits as “comorbidities.” Specifically, the bootstrap method20,24,25 includes two steps: a) We resampled 1,000 times with each time randomly choosing 75% cases to calculate the mean of the indicator among two groups; b) We then summarized the average and calculated the 95% confidence interval (CI) as the range of the 2.5th and 97.5th percentile of each group.
Sensitivity analyses.
Multiple sensitivity analyses were conducted to test if the results were robust, including the following: a) To exclude the confounding effect of Superstorm Hurricane Sandy, a sensitivity analysis was conducted by removing the Hurricane Sandy period in NYS, i.e., 27 October 2012 to 8 November 2012 (13 d) as defined by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)49 since multiple prior studies have found that Hurricane Sandy was associated with adverse health effects26,50,51; b) To test the method’s robustness, we employed point-to-point pairing by matching event starting coordinates with division centroids and reanalyzed our main result; c) We compared different PO thresholds and multiple indicators of environmental modifiers to validate our findings; d) The potential pathway of thunderstorm-health association was examined through mediation analysis of PM2.5 and RH as well as pollen seasons; and e) Finally, a sensitivity analysis was also performed to evaluate how PM2.5 and RH affected the RR with or without them in the models.
Results
A total of 10,674,742 ED cases with a principal diagnosis of respiratory diseases were reported in NYS during 2005–2018. Approximately 39% of ED cases had respiratory allergy diseases, followed by asthma (22%), other disease subtypes (13%), respiratory infections (11%), bronchitis (10%), and COPD (5%) (Table 1). Both the number of thunderstorms and POs increased over time with the larger slope of increase after 2015, especially for POs (Figure S1A). Thunderstorms occurred frequently during warm seasons while POs happened more frequently during winter (Figure S1B).

The effect of thunderstorms/POs, both jointly and independently, on total respiratory diseases is presented in Table 2. After adjusting for confounders, the joint thunderstorms/POs at single-day lag were significantly associated with respiratory ED visits on lag days 0 and 1, with risk ratios (RR) of 1.09 (95% CI: 1.04, 1.15) and 1.05 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.09), respectively. Consistently, the independent effects of thunderstorms and POs were similar and statistically significant on lag 0 with RR of 1.02 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.03) and RR of 1.02 (95% CI: 1.01,1.02), respectively. Conversely, we observed slightly protective effects of the joint event on respiratory outcomes from lag days 3–5. The results for multiday lags were similar, i.e., the thunderstorm/PO joint effect was the highest and occurred on the same day with a RR of 1.09 (95% CI: 1.04, 1.15) and was larger than the impact of thunderstorms (RR = 1.02; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.03) or POs alone (RR = 1.02; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.02). We also observed protective effects of the joint event from multi-lag days 0–4 to 0–8. As the significantly highest risks for all respiratory disease occurred only on lag days 0–1 and the associations disappeared or reduced afterward, we presented the single-lag day only later.

RR was obtained by adjusting for O3, temperature, day of the week, holidays, time, and year in the distributed lag nonlinear model.
In Figure 1 (and Table S1), we illustrate the independent and joint impact of thunderstorms and POs on six subtypes of respiratory diseases. We found that the risks of most respiratory disease subtypes were significantly and consistently associated with thunderstorms or POs, respectively (RRs ranged from 1.01 to 1.12), except for respiratory allergy diseases. The adverse health risks occurred immediately after these events. Thunderstorms had a stronger health effect than POs on asthma, COPD, respiratory infections, and other respiratory diseases. The independent effects of thunderstorms (RR=1.12; 95% CI: 1.08, 1.17) or POs (RR=1.11; 95% CI: 1.09, 1.13) were the highest on COPD. However, the point estimates of different subtypes were within each other’s confidence intervals, suggesting that they did not statistically significantly differ from each other. More importantly, the risks of all respiratory diseases were the strongest when both thunderstorms and POs cooccurred [RRs ranged from 1.07 (with 95% CI: 1.01, 1.12) to 1.44 (with 95% CI: 1.22, 1.70)] compared to when those events occurred alone. These adverse risks lasted for more than a week. Additionally, we found unexpected protective effects of the joint events on respiratory infections ED visits from lag days 3–10.
Figure 1. Effects of thunderstorms and POs, jointly and separately, on emergency department visits for six subtypes of respiratory diseases by lag days in New York State (n=10,674,742), 2005–2018. Note: RR was obtained by adjusting for O3, temperature, day of the week, holidays, time, and year in the distributed lag nonlinear model. The numeric value is shown in Table S1. COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; PO, power outage; RR, risk ratio.
The joint and independent effects of thunderstorms and POs on total respiratory diseases by different quantiles of PO coverage (lag 0) are described in Figure S2. The effects from POs alone or the joint thunderstorm/PO effects were higher as the PO coverage increased. The potential exposure–health threshold was present when the PO coverage exceeded the 50th percentile (RR=1.06; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.10) and reached the highest at the 90th percentile (RR=1.25; 95% CI: 1.15, 1.35).
The disparities of the joint thunderstorms/POs effect on ED visits (lag 0) for all respiratory diseases by different demographics and seasons are displayed in Figure 2. People residing in non-NYC (RR=1.10; 95% CI: 1.05, 1.16) were at higher health risks from thunderstorms/POs than those in NYC (RR=0.76; 95% CI: 0.50, 1.15). Additionally, the health risks were higher in the spring (RR=1.17; 95% CI: 1.06, 1.30) and summer (RR=1.20; 95% CI: 1.12, 1.29) compared to fall and winter. Older adults (>65 years old; RR=1.36; 95% CI: 1.20, 1.53), school-age children (6–17 years old; RR=1.37; 95% CI: 1.16, 1.62), and people of Hispanic ethnicity (RR=1.25; 95% CI: 1.04, 1.50) seem to have higher respiratory health risks compared to other age groups and people with non-Hispanic ethnicity, although these differences were not statistically significant. Heterogeneity tests show that people without insurance (or self-paid) (RR=1.59; 95% CI: 1.29, 1.97), Medicare recipients (RR=1.35; 95% CI: 1.21, 1.50), and rural residents (RR=1.65; 95% CI: 1.32, 2.08) have significantly higher risk ratios than groups without these factors, respectively. In Figure 2, we marked the groups with significant differences with asterisks (*) and presented the exact p-values in Table S2.

Joint effects of thunderstorms and POs on emergency department visits for all respiratory diseases among different demographic subgroups and seasons on lag 0 in New York State (n=10,674,742), 2005–2018. Note: The distributed lag nonlinear model was adjusted for O3, temperature, day of the week, holidays, time and year by different groups. In panel F, Spring includes March–May, Summer includes June–August, Fall includes September–November, and Winter includes December–February. In panel H, Central indicates large central metro area, Fringe indicates large fringe metro area, Medium indicates medium metro area, Small indicates small metro area, Micro indicates micropolitan area, and Noncore indicates noncore area. These six levels were defined using the Urban-Rural Classification Scheme developed by National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) to classify US counties based on whether they are metropolitan or nonmetropolitan. For instance, noncore areas are counties that are not micropolitan or metro and have no city, town, or urban cluster with 10,000 or more residents. Micropolitan counties are similar to metro counties but have an urban core with a population between 10,000 and 49,999. While noncore areas and micropolitan areas may be the traditionally rural areas, the other four levels, including large central metro area, large fringe metro area, medium metro area, and small metro areas, are defined as metropolitan areas or countries.47 Whites serve as a comparison group when comparing the differences among racial groups. Females, non-Hispanics, age groups of 18–44 years old, Medicaid recipients, winter, NYC residents, and residents in large fringe metropolitan areas are chosen as the comparison group since they had the smallest RR. We marked the groups with significant differences (i.e., p<0.05) with asterisks (*). The exact RR and p-value for all groups is shown in Table S2. PO, power outage; NYC, New York City; RR, risk ratio.
In Table 3, we assessed if the thunderstorm/PO–health associations were stronger during different pollen seasons as compared to nonpollen season. The strongest health effects of thunderstorms/POs were observed during grass pollen-dominated seasons on the same day with RR=1.28 (95% CI: 1.16, 1.40), followed by ragweed and tree pollen season with the highest risks on lag day 7 for ragweed (RR=1.20; 95% CI: 1.12, 1.29) and lag day 6 for tree pollen (RR=1.12; 95% CI: 1.04, 1.21), respectively. The health risks of thunderstorm/PO during grass and ragweed seasons lasted for 10 d, but the adverse risks during tree pollen season were late-onset (lag 6–8 d after thunderstorm/PO). Conversely, no significant risks of thunderstorms/POs were observed during the no-pollen season (even protective effects were found on lag 3–10 d). We also found no effect during the cool-viral season (Table S3).

Comorbidities were determined using up to 24 “other diagnoses” in the SPARCS database, distinct from the principal diagnosis. Each additional diagnosis was counted as a separate comorbidity. All respiratory diseases include asthma, bronchitis, COPD, respiratory infections, respiratory allergic diseases, and other respiratory diseases.
As described in Table 5, there were significant multiplicative interactions (p-values of product terms <0.05) between thunderstorms and all potential effect modifiers including extreme heat/cold, high RH, PM2.5, and O3 when using different thresholds. We also found consistently positive additive interactions between these variables and thunderstorms, suggested by RERI>0, AP>0, and SI>1 except for the cases of PM2.5, and O3 at the 50% threshold. The stratified analysis results showed that RRs for the joint occurrence of each modifier and thunderstorms were the highest and significantly higher than the RRs of either thunderstorm or exposure alone. The joint effect showed the highest RRs in the highest exposure threshold level. Among all these modifiers, extreme cold (5%) had the strongest interaction with thunderstorm with RR=1.47 (95% CI: 1.08, 2.00), followed by 99% RH (RR=1.19; 95% CI: 1.05, 1.34), 90% O3 (RR=1.13; 95% CI: 1.10, 1.16), 99% extreme heat (RR=1.10; 95% CI: 1.05, 1.16), and 90% PM2.5 (RR=1.10; 95% CI: 1.07, 1.13). Table S4 presents minimum and maximum values of extreme heat/cold, high RH, PM2.5, and O3 by each threshold across each month.

As described in Table 6 for mediation analysis, we found that the direct effect (0.018; 95% CI: 0.006, 0.030) of thunderstorms on respiratory diseases was stronger than the indirect effects from PM2.5 (0.010) or RH (0.011) as the mediators, respectively. Approximately 36% of the effect was mediated by PM2.5, and 38% was mediated by RH on the thunderstorm–health relationships.

A sensitivity analysis revealed that the models additionally adjusting for PM2.5, and RH (Table S5) yielded identical RRs of thunderstorms on health, which indicated that these two variables are not important confounders in this study. Table S6 shows the sensitivity analysis results after excluding Hurricane Sandy. Table S7 presents another sensitivity analysis using point-to-point pairing between thunderstorm occurrence location and centroid of power divisions. Both analyses indicate that the joint effect of thunderstorms and POs was greater than the separate effect of either event. We also found that the results were consistent when comparing different PO thresholds (Figure S2) or when using multiple indicators of environmental modifiers as described in Table 5.
Discussion
Independent Effects of Thunderstorms and POs
We found that both thunderstorms and POs alone have similarly significant adverse effects on respiratory diseases. The independent health effects of thunderstorms were consistently found in previous work in different regions. For instance, following a thunderstorm in 1994 in London, approximately 10 times as many patients with asthma or other airway diseases attended the ED than expected.52 Thien et al.8 demonstrated excess respiratory-related ED visits after a thunderstorm in Melbourne, Australia in 2016. As POs have been significantly increasing since 2015 in NYS on a larger scale than thunderstorms, this study also supported the important health impact of POs. There has been limited research regarding the health effects of PO. Dominianni et al.18 found that the 2006 localized outages in NYC were correlated with higher risks of respiratory hospitalization. A review by Casey et al.19 also summarized the adverse effects of POs on respiratory diseases.
Joint Effect of Thunderstorms and POs
One unique and important finding from this study was that the impact of thunderstorms on respiratory diseases was stronger when they coincided with POs compared to those events occurring alone. Due to lack of PO data access, little or no prior research could be found to compare with our results regarding the strong thunderstorm–PO joint effect. However, our findings may be indirectly supported by some earlier studies that identified the highest health risks when a PO happened in conjunction with winter storms,23,24 windstorms,25 and hurricanes,26,27 although various disasters may have different health impacts. While Qu et al.22 observed significant mediation effects of POs on all major storms–COPD associations, their results were focused on COPD and did not separate the effects of different storms.
Our findings are further supported by the evidence of a clear dose–response relationship with the potential joint exposure–health threshold from the 50th percentile. As both thunderstorm and PO were defined at the group level and not the individual level, the highest joint effect of these two exposures could be due to the additional effect of POs or could be an indicator of thunderstorm severity.
Nevertheless, we also found protective effects of thunderstorm/PO, which were mainly on respiratory infections. We hypothesize that thunderstorms and POs may change people’s activity patterns, i.e., spending more time indoors, and lead to reduced exposure to external social contacts and transmission of infectious pathogens, such as influenza viruses and respiratory bacteria. This needs further validation in future studies.
Lag Effects, Disease Subtypes, and Comorbidity
We found that the joint effects on all respiratory diseases occurred immediately and was the strongest on the same day of exposure. Furthermore, the joint effects of thunderstorms/POs persistently lasted for 10 d for multiple respiratory diseases, including asthma, bronchitis, COPD, and other respiratory diseases. However, the joint effects on respiratory infections and allergy diseases were short-term and only occurred on lag 0–1 d. For exposure to thunderstorms only, two previous studies reported significant adverse effects occurring on the same day of thunderstorms in Louisiana9 and Minnesota,11 respectively. In terms of the lag effect of POs, Dominianni et al.18 and Zhang et al.20 highlight that POs significantly increase hospitalizations for respiratory and COPD hospitalization in NYC and NYS, predominantly on lag 0–1 d. As most prior studies only evaluated the short-term or same day effect after thunderstorms,9,11 no literature is available to be compared with our long lag-day findings.
Our results also indicated that thunderstorms and POs alone were significantly associated with the risks of most respiratory disease subtypes, but the risks of joint thunderstorm/PO on all subtypes were consistently the strongest. While there were no significant differences on risk magnitudes by subtypes, the higher risks of joint thunderstorm/PO were observed in bronchitis, asthma, and COPD (44%, 41%, and 38% increases, respectively). The effects of thunderstorms alone or POs alone were the highest on COPD (12% and 11% higher, respectively). Previous studies have mainly focused on thunderstorm-related asthma. Grundstein et al.10 demonstrated a 3% increase in asthma ED visits after thunderstorms alone in Atlanta, Georgia. Hew et al.53 also found that hospital admission for asthma was higher [adjusted Odds Ratio (OR)=1.87; 95% CI: 1.26, 2.78] after thunderstorms in Melborne, Australia. Zou et al.2 revealed that the thunderstorms in the US were associated with 1.2% increases in ED visits for asthma and COPD among Medicare beneficiaries. Unfortunately, except for asthma, there is a lack of research on other respiratory diseases after thunderstorm/PO co-occurrences.
In addition, we observed that the average number of comorbidities was significantly higher by 0.650 per case after thunderstorm/PO events. This may imply that the thunderstorm/PO combination is associated with more severe health effects with more complications, or that individuals with multiple existing comorbidities were more susceptible to joint thunderstorm/PO events. Although there is little literature to compare with our findings, Zhang et al.20 found that the average number of comorbidities for COPD hospitalizations was significantly elevated by 1.38 per case after any PO. Lin et al.24 reported that the number of comorbidities was significantly higher by 1.1 per case for lower respiratory diseases, and 0.4 per case for respiratory infections during winter storms and POs.
Disparities by Demographics, Seasons, Weather Factors, and Air Pollution
Our study showed a possible U-shaped curve of ED visits after thunderstorm/PO events by age, i.e., school-age (6–17 years old) children and older adults (≥65 years old) may be the most susceptible to the joint effects. We also observed that Hispanics, those without insurance, and rural residents were at higher respiratory risks than other groups.
Although there were no directly comparable studies regarding the disparities in the effects of thunderstorms/POs, Hew et al.53 found that the risk of thunderstorm asthma ED visits increased with age. Older adults typically experience weakened immune responses54 and age-related organ dysfunction and have multiple comorbidities or baseline diseases,55,56 which complicates their ability to prepare for and react to extreme weather events.57,58 Children are more sensitive to external environmental hazards compared to healthy adults because they have a higher metabolic rate per kilogram of body weight, greater body surface-to-volume ratio, high activity levels, and limited adaptive ability.59,60 Related to our findings on demographic disparities, Zhang et al.20 also observed higher RR on COPD hospitalization for Hispanics than non-Hispanics after POs. Deng et al.27 showed that people who are uninsured had the greatest risk due to cardiovascular disease (CVD) after joint hurricanes and POs. Individuals with Hispanic ethnicity, those without insurance coverage, or those with lower socioeconomic status (SES)61,62 may have inadequate housing and less resilience to extreme weather events. Lack of insurance or low SES can further cause delayed or compromised medical care post-thunderstorm, especially for those with preexisting health conditions.63
Additionally, we found that people residing in non-NYC or rural areas were affected more than those in NYC or urban areas after thunderstorms/POs. This may be explained by different atmospheric conditions, ambient air pollution, indoor environments, access to care, or other factors.40,41 Consistently, Call64 indicated that POs in rural areas lasted longer than in urban areas due to aging electricity grids and the difficulty in detecting and repairing damage. Compared to urban areas, rural areas have fewer resources related to the hardening of electric infrastructure, have reluctance to invest in operations and maintenance,65 receive lower priority in disaster recovery efforts, and suffer from long-lasting road blockages and poor road conditions, making it difficult for restoration crews to reach the damaged facilities in a timely manner.65
We identified the higher health risks of joint thunderstorm/PO events during warm seasons (i.e., summer and spring), especially during pollen seasons (e.g., dominated seasons of grass pollen, ragweed, and tree pollen). In addition, our event data in NYS showed that most thunderstorms occurred in summer (68.39%), followed by spring (17.51%) during our study period. Park et al.9 also found that summertime had the most lightning strikes and thunderstorm days in Louisiana. In terms of pollen, a systematic review by Idrose et al.66 identified increasing grass pollen counts as a necessary and important factor for thunderstorm asthma. In a Minnesota study, thunderstorms with two or more lightning strikes and high pollen levels (≥75% for tree, grass, or weed) were associated with a higher risk of ED visits.17 Additionally, thunderstorms are widely recognized for their capacity to trigger large-scale allergic respiratory infections by causing the fragmentation of suspended pollen particles into smaller, inhalable particles.17,39 Lightning can also positively charge these airborne allergens, making them more likely to settle in the lungs.9
Other important findings included that extreme cold/heat, high RH, high concentrations of PM2.5, and O3 significantly modified or aggregated the adverse respiratory effect of thunderstorm with positive additive and multiplicative interactions across different thresholds of modifiers. D’Amato et al.7 reported that people exposed to outdoor pollutants were more likely to suffer from thunderstorm asthma compared to those who were not. Thien et al.8 observed a drop in temperature, a rise in humidity, and a high concentration of particulate matter during the Melbourne thunderstorm. The study of Park et al.9 demonstrated that lower temperature and higher precipitation were associated with thunderstorm asthma ED visits in Louisiana.
Possible Biological Mechanism
Thunderstorms may lead to rapid changes in temperature, high precipitation, alterations in air pollutant levels, and elevation of pollen counts that affect air quality and trigger respiratory responses.66–68 Our findings also found that PM2.5 and RH are mediators in the pathway of thunderstorm/PO–respiratory diseases, i.e., over one-third of the effect of thunderstorms on respiratory outcomes may be mediated by PM2.5 and RH. POs, when coinciding with thunderstorms, could cause the interruption of critical electrical equipment for some respiratory treatment, such as ventilators or oxygen supply for COPD and nebulizers/inhalers for asthma.20,22 In addition, lack of power for water towers, refrigerators, sewage treatment plants, and heaters would affect the quality of drinking water, food, and thermal comfort for respiratory patients and increase the risks of comorbidities (water/food-borne diseases, cold-related diseases, etc.).24,69 The increased physical and psychological stress after the co-occurrence of thunderstorms and POs, especially among populations with limited transportation to access health care, residence in high-rise buildings, and lack of medication/treatment or communication, may trigger respiratory disease exacerbation.18,24 Furthermore, using generators during POs could deteriorate indoor air quality and accelerate respiratory diseases.70
Strengths and Limitations
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study assessing both the joint and independent effects of thunderstorms and POs on respiratory health. We took advantage of the tremendous number of ED visits in the large state of NY with over 10 million visits for respiratory diseases from 2005 to 2018, representing all age groups and a diverse population by race/ethnicity. Unlike most prior studies focusing on asthma only, we considered all respiratory diseases and their subtypes, providing a comprehensive picture regarding the respiratory impacts of thunderstorms and POs. Other innovative contributions of our study include using a large, unique PO dataset, identifying exposure–health thresholds, and examining the impacts on comorbidities. Furthermore, this study provides new evidence to identify disparities of demographics, seasonal patterns, and urbanicity level, as well as modifying or mediating effects of weather factors and air pollution levels on the exposure–health relationship.
In terms of potential limitations, our results might have underestimated the total burden of thunderstorms and POs on respiratory diseases, as we only included cases severe enough to result in an ED visit or outpatient visit in a hospital. Future studies in this area may include mild cases from clinics and more extreme cases with hospitalization (which will be our next step). A large cohort would also be a good design for following up and identifying all respiratory cases after disasters. However, acute episodes of the major respiratory diseases we studied, such as asthma, COPD, bronchitis, and pneumonia, are often severe and require immediate medical care and timely treatment through the ED. Therefore, ED records may be a good data source for assessing urgent care for respiratory diseases. Another concern is the potential confounding effects, but temperature, O3, day of the week, holidays, and seasonal effect have been controlled in the DLNM model. The multiplicative and additive modification effects of these factors were also assessed. To minimize the confounding effects by special weather events, we also conducted a sensitivity analysis by excluding all the cases occurring during the 13-d period of Hurricane Sandy and reran the analysis. The results remained the same as the original analysis. Another potential concern is the unavailability of data for some confounders, such as access to medical care, housing and food insecurity, and activity patterns may impact our findings. Additionally, spatial differences or temporal changes in sociodemographic characteristics within the study period may also be confounders or modifiers. We did check that there were no significant temporal changes in the population composition in NYS during the study period. As the comparison with-/without-thunderstorm/PO periods were conducted at the same power operating division, the sociodemographic confounders in the same location should remain similar, and therefore, the population distribution should not have a substantial impact on our findings. Finally, it would be better to consider the modification effect of pollen concentration following thunderstorms, as allergic pollens may be an important reason for thunderstorm asthma epidemic.66 Unfortunately, pollen data in NYS is currently not available, but we have identified the joint effects of grass, ragweed, and tree pollens with thunderstorm by using pollen season as a pollen exposure surrogate. To validate our findings, we also conducted multiple sensitivity analyses, including refining exposure buffers, examining modifications of air pollution and meteorological factors, assessing potential pathway of thunderstorm–health association through mediation analysis, and comparing different PO thresholds and multiple indicators of environmental modifiers. Our major results remain robust after performing all of these sensitivity analyses.
Future Steps and Recommendations
Our findings require validation by future studies with complete case ascertainment, and complete data on confounding factors such as pollen and indoor environment. Future studies, including laboratory studies, should examine the potential mechanism of how thunderstorms/POs affect various respiratory diseases. While our results require further confirmation, some key findings provide insights into disaster and emergency preparedness efforts. For instance, public health and emergency management agencies should pay more attention to the immediate strongest and long-lasting joint effects of thunderstorms/POs, warning of the health risks in advance, and conducting post-event infrastructure recovery in a timely manner. Clinical facilities, especially in rural areas, should be aware of the health burden on all respiratory diseases (not only asthma) after thunderstorms/POs as well as peak seasons (summer and spring) or pollen months to plan accordingly for hospital bed, treatments, and staffing needs. Education provided to individuals with respiratory diseases and other susceptible populations by public health agencies should emphasize the importance of self-management behaviors, such as prefilling medication prescriptions and taking preventive actions to reduce the risk of respiratory disease exacerbation, storing clean water and food before thunderstorms/POs, as well as communication or other practical strategies during these disasters.
Conclusion
Thunderstorms were significantly associated with the risks for multiple respiratory ED visits, especially among the patients with multiple comorbidities. The impact was more pronounced when accompanied by POs and enhanced with PO coverage exceeding 50%. The strongest health risks occurred immediately on the same day and the effects on COPD, bronchitis, and asthma persisted for 10 d. People of Hispanic ethnicity, school-age children, older adults, individuals without insurance, and rural residents seemed more susceptible to these effects than other groups. High levels of air pollution, extreme cold/heat, and high RH showed positive additive and multiplicative interactions with thunderstorms on respiratory health. Early warnings and preparedness are essential in rural areas, during summer and spring especially for pollen seasons.
