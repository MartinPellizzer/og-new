Here is a summary of the study in one paragraph, focusing on the information related to ozone:

The research describes the development of an ultraviolet (UVC) robot with a sustainable ozone control system for sanitizing and eliminating viruses and bacteria from surfaces and enclosed spaces. The robot uses six UVC cylindrical lamps emitting energy at 253.7 nm, which radiates 4.5382 J/m² of energy in 14.76 seconds to disinfect an area of 0.98-1.04 m² with a power consumption of 30 W per lamp. The sustainable ozone control system uses MQ-131 and MQ-135 sensors to automatically turn off the robot when it is not in use, avoiding environmental contamination.
