Here is a summary of the study in one detailed paragraph, focusing on the information and data related to ozone:

This study explores the role of small RNAs (sRNAs) regulated by FNR transcriptional regulators in controlling bacterial denitrification, which affects nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions that contribute to ozone depletion. Seven sRNAs with a putative FNR binding motif were identified on the Paracoccus denitrificans genome and characterized. Three of these sRNAs, sRNA18, sRNA36, and sRNA79, showed characteristics indicating involvement in denitrification. Overexpression of sRNA36 impacted N2O reduction rates, and regulation by FNR was experimentally confirmed. Notably, the study highlights that denitrification, a major source of ozone-depleting N2O emissions, is tightly regulated by transcriptional regulators and may also be influenced by sRNAs under FNR control.
