In conclusion, this study demonstrates the effectiveness of photocatalytic ozonation-electroflucculation using modified bentonite/UV/TiO2/ZnO for treating real pharmaceutical wastewater. The results indicate that the combined process can achieve high removal efficiencies for COD and turbidity, as well as antibiotic removal. This novel photocatalyst and hybrid system show promise for large-scale applications, aligning with UN sustainability goals. Future studies should explore further optimization and scaling up of this treatment technology.
