The study used a combination of numerical simulation and statistical methods to analyze the spatiotemporal characteristics of O3 pollution in Siping. The simulation was conducted using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model with the Chemistry component (WRF-Chem). The simulated data were compared with observational data from a monitoring station in Siping. Additionally, local source contributions were estimated using the Community Multi-scale Air Quality modeling system (CMAQ).
