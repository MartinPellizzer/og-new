Abstract:
It has been reported that low resistive corona armor tape (CAT) deteriorates due to partial discharge (PD) after the start of operation. The deterioration of CAT is a significant concern as it directly affects the machine's lifetime, so it is important to evaluate the CAT lifetime. We clarified that the CAT lifetime can be organized using PD energy measured by the V-Q Lissajous method. In this paper, we report the lifetime comparison results of two types of CAT materials, polyester-based CAT and silicone-based CAT.

I. Introduction
Low-resistive corona armor tape (CAT) is used to inhibit the occurrence of partial discharge (PD) for form-wound rotating machines. CAT is a tape material that involves coating a binder resin with added carbon black onto the substrate. Fig. 1 shows the electric insulation system of a stator coil. The main insulation layer made from mica is placed around the stator coil conductor with high voltage [1]. CAT is placed between the main insulation layer and the stator core with ground voltage. The low resistivity of CAT material leads to a reduction in the electric field between the surface of the main insulation and the stator core. Therefore, the occurrence of PD between the surface of the main insulation and the stator core is prevented.
