In conclusion, this study provides evidence that FNR-regulated sRNAs play a critical role in controlling bacterial denitrification. The identification of specific sRNAs with putative FNR binding motifs upstream of their promoters offers new avenues for investigating the regulation of denitrification and N2O emissions. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms by which these sRNAs regulate denitrification, but this study provides a crucial step forward in our understanding of this complex process.
