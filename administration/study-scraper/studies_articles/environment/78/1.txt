The LIFE SIRIUS approach involves an integrated analysis of recent emissions, pollutant concentrations, and health impacts over Cyprus. The study utilized 10 years of measurements of main atmospheric pollutants to assess anthropogenic emissions and pollutant concentrations in the country. Additionally, a first study was conducted on the lagged effects of heat stress and air pollution synergy at daily temporal resolution over Cyprus based on 16 years of data.
