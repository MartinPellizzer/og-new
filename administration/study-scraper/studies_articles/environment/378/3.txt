The results highlight the potential of the magnesium oxide-based nanocatalyst in photocatalytic ozonation for efficient removal of Acid Blue 113 dye from wastewater. The optimized conditions identified in this study can be used as a guideline for industrial-scale applications. Additionally, the high reusability and stability of the nanocatalyst make it an attractive option for environmental remediation.
