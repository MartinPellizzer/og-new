    "abstract": "If oil sands process-affected water (OSPW) is to be returned to the environment, a desire is that it not adversely affect aquatic life. We investigated whether a relevant model fish (rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss) could detect OSPW using its olfactory sense (smell) and whether exposure to it would result in behavioral changes. We also investigated whether ozonation of OSPW, which lowers the concentration of organic compounds attributed with toxicity (naphthenic acids), would ameliorate any observed adverse effects. We found that OSPW, regardless of ozonation, evoked olfactory tissue responses similar to those expected of natural odorants, suggesting that fish could smell OSPW. In 30 min OSPW exposures, olfactory responses to a food odorant and a pheromone were reduced to a similar degree by OSPW, again regardless of ozonation. However, olfactory responses returned within minutes of exposure cessation. In contrast, in longer (7 d) exposures, olfactory responses remained impaired, but not in fish that had received ozone-treated OSPW. In the behavioral assay, fish avoided an introduced plume of OSPW, and this response was not affected by ozonation. Taken together, our data suggest that fish smell OSPW, that they may use this sense to mount an avoidance response, and that, if they cannot avoid it, their sensory responses may be impaired, unless the OSPW has received some remediation."
