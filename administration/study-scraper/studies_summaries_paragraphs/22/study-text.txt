Here is a detailed summary of the study in 1 paragraph, focusing on the information and data related to ozone:

The study investigated the air oxidation and ozone-enhanced oxidation of industrial zinc sulfite from flue gas desulfurization. The experiments were conducted under constant temperature conditions with slurry concentrations ranging from 0.5-4%, oxygen levels between 10-60%, and ozone concentrations at 1100-1920 ppm. The results showed that ozone enhanced the oxidation rate by an average of 15% by affecting the non-mass transfer control stage, while the mass transfer rate of O2 and/or O3 determined the reaction rate in the main stage. Furthermore, ozone caused organic matter attached to industrial zinc sulfite particles to fall off into solution, significantly improving the oxidation ratio.
