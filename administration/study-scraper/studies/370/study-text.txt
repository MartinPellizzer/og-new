Uncover the Secret: What is Kombucha & Its Health Benefits?
July 20, 2023 / Brio-Medical, Scottsdale AZ / No Comments
Are you curious about the new health drink that everyone is raving about? Wondering what is komboucha and what makes it so special? Kombucha is a naturally fermented tea that has been used for centuries due to its many potential health benefits.
Known for its unique taste, kombucha is made from tea, sugar, and a culture of bacteria and yeast. During fermentation, this culture consumes the sugar and produces organic acids, enzymes, probiotics, and amino acids. This cocktail of nutrients is believed to support digestion, immunity, and overall health.
In this article, we’ll take a deeper dive into kombucha and explore its many health benefits. From its origins to its potential role in cancer treatment, we’ll cover everything you need to know about this trendy health drink. So, let’s get started and discover the secrets of kombucha!
What is Kombucha?
Kombucha, also known as “tea mushroom”, is a fermented tea that has been consumed for thousands of years. The origin of Kombucha is unclear, but it is believed to have originated in Russia or China.
Kombucha is made by fermenting black or green tea with sugar and a symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast (SCOBY). The SCOBY consumes the sugar and tea, producing various organic acids, vitamins and trace amounts of ethanol.
What is SCOBY?
SCOBY stands for Symbiotic Colony Of Bacteria and Yeast. It is a rubbery, pancake-shaped culture that contains both yeast and bacteria, and is the key ingredient in Kombucha production. The SCOBY metabolizes the sugar in the tea, converting it into various organic acids, vitamins and trace amounts of ethanol.
Organic Acids Vitamins
Acetic Acid B vitamins
Lactic Acid Vitamin C
Gluconic Acid Vitamin D
The organic acids produced by the SCOBY give kombucha its characteristic sour taste, while the vitamins and other compounds contribute to its potential health benefits.
Next, we will explore the more detailed fermentation process of kombucha in Section 3.
The Fermentation Process
Kombucha is made by fermenting tea with a symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast, commonly referred to as SCOBY. The resulting drink is slightly effervescent and tart with a slightly sweet taste.
How to Make Kombucha:
Here is a simple recipe for making kombucha at home:
Ingredients: Tools:
8 tea bags
1 cup white granulated sugar
SCOBY
1 cup starter tea (previously brewed kombucha)
Filtered water
1-gallon glass jar
Breathable cloth (such as cheesecloth or coffee filter)
Band or string to secure cloth
pH strips to test acidity
Instructions:
Boil 4 cups of water and steep tea bags for 5-7 minutes.
Remove tea bags and stir in sugar until fully dissolved.
Fill the glass jar halfway with filtered water and add the sweet tea mixture.
Add the SCOBY and starter tea.
Fill the rest of the jar with filtered water, leaving an inch of space at the top.
Cover the jar with a breathable cloth and secure with a band or string.
Let the mixture ferment at room temperature for 7-14 days, depending on the desired level of acidity.
Test the pH regularly with strips until it reaches a range between 2.5 and 4.
Once it reaches the desired acidity level, remove the SCOBY and store it in a glass container with 1 cup of kombucha for future use.
Enjoy your homemade kombucha!
Kombucha Probiotics:
Kombucha is known for its probiotics, which are beneficial bacteria that live in our digestive system. These probiotics help to improve gut health and boost the immune system. Kombucha also contains antioxidants and small amounts of alcohol, which are produced during the fermentation process.
Health Benefits of Komboucha
Kombucha is known to be a rich source of probiotics that provide a variety of health benefits to the body. Besides being packed with enzymes and antioxidants, kombucha has been found to help improve digestion and boost immunity. Here are some of the health benefits of consuming kombucha:
Benefit Description
Gut Health Kombucha contains beneficial bacteria that have a positive impact on gut health. Consuming kombucha can help maintain a healthy balance of gut flora and improve digestion.
Immunity Boost Kombucha’s high concentration of antioxidants can help protect the body from chronic diseases and boost the immune system.
Detoxification The enzymes in kombucha help to break down toxins in the body, leading to a more efficient detoxification process.
Additionally, kombucha has been linked to improved mental health, increased energy levels, and anti-inflammatory effects.
Using Kombucha for Holistic Cancer Treatment
While there is no definitive research yet on the effectiveness of kombucha in cancer treatment, there has been interest in exploring the potential benefits of using it as part of a holistic approach to cancer care. Some natural cancer treatment centers such as Brio-Medical Cancer Center include kombucha as part of their integrative cancer treatment plan.
Kombucha’s high concentration of antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds has been found to help reduce inflammation and oxidative stress, which are both associated with cancer development. Additionally, kombucha’s probiotic content may help to improve gut health, which has been linked to better overall health outcomes.
As part of a holistic cancer treatment plan, kombucha may provide additional support for cancer patients.
Nutritional Value of Komboucha
Komboucha is a fermented tea beverage that has been gaining popularity in recent years due to its purported health benefits. But beyond its potential medicinal properties, komboucha is also a rich source of various nutrients that can contribute to a healthy diet.
Komboucha Ingredients
The primary ingredients used to make komboucha are tea, sugar, and a symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast (SCOBY).
The type of tea used can vary, although black tea is the most common choice. The sugar serves as a food source for the SCOBY during the fermentation process, which can take anywhere from 7 to 21 days.

It is important to note that the nutritional value of komboucha can vary depending on the specific recipe and brand. It is also important to consume in moderation due to its sugar content and potential side effects.
Potential Side Effects of Kombucha
While kombucha has many potential health benefits, it is important to be aware of any potential side effects or risks associated with consuming it.
Risk of Contamination
Because kombucha is made through a fermentation process, there is a risk of contamination if it is not prepared properly. Consuming contaminated kombucha can result in illness or infection. To reduce the risk of contamination, it is important to always use clean equipment and follow proper fermentation techniques.
High Acidity
Kombucha is highly acidic, which can cause gastrointestinal issues for some individuals, particularly those with sensitive stomachs or existing stomach issues. It is important to consume kombucha in moderation and consult a healthcare provider if you experience any negative side effects.
Potential for Overconsumption of Sugar
Kombucha is often made with added sugar, which can lead to overconsumption of sugar if consumed in large quantities. It is important to read labels carefully and choose kombucha brands that use minimal added sugars.
The Potential Role of Kombucha in Cancer Treatment
Kombucha has been gaining attention as a potential aid in cancer treatment. While more research is needed in this area, some holistic and integrative cancer centers are incorporating kombucha into their treatment plans.
What is Holistic Cancer Treatment?
Holistic cancer treatment involves a focus on the whole person, including their physical, emotional, and spiritual well-being. This approach is intended to support the body’s natural healing processes and improve the patient’s overall quality of life.
Natural and Integrative Cancer Treatments
Integrative cancer treatment combines conventional medical approaches with complementary therapies, such as acupuncture, massage, and herbal remedies. Natural cancer treatments may include dietary changes, supplements, and other alternative therapies.
Kombucha at Brio-Medical Cancer Center
The Brio-Medical Cancer Center in Scottsdale, Arizona, offers integrative cancer treatment options that include kombucha therapy. According to their website, kombucha can help support the immune system and improve gut health, which can be beneficial for cancer patients undergoing treatment.
