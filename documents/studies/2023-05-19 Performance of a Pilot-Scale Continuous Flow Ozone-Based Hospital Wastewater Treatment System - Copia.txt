---------------------------------------------------

problem:
	Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is becoming a global concern.

experiment:
	Metagenomic analysis was conducted
	inactivation of general gut bacteria, including Bacteroides, Prevotella, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, 
		DNA molecules, and ARGs, as well as antimicrobials

result:
	Azithromycin and doxycycline removal rates were >99% immediately after treatment
	levofloxacin and vancomycin removal rates remained between 90% and 97% for approximately one month
	Clarithromycin was more readily removed than the other antimicrobials (81â€“91%)
	no clear removal trend was observed for ampicillin
		
objective:
	good
