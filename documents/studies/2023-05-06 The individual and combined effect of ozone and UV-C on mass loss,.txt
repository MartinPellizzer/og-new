problem:
	UVC+O3 VS quality characteristics of fresh-cut lettuce
	(mass loss, colour, texture and respiration rate)

experiment:
	Fresh-cut ‘Romaine’ lettuce (Lactuca sativa L. var. longifolia)
	exposed to:
		1. three fluences 0.20, 0.40 and 0.80 kJ/m2 of UVC (254 nm)
		2. gaseous O3 of 5 mg/L for 5 min
	stored unpackaged for 5 days at 5.7°C and 91.95% 
	
result:
	mass loss decreased by 25% (UVC+O3)
	respiration rate increased (especially UVC)
	crispness increased by 35% (UVC+O3)
	colour degradation limited below UVC 5 kJ/m2 and O3 < 5 mg/L

objective:
	lettuce quality are enhanced with O3
