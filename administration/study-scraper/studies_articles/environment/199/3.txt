Regression analysis showed significant decreasing trends in annual mean concentrations of NO and NO2 across all four investigated stations over the study period, likely due to the implementation of strategies and actions to curb emissions from the road transport sector. However, this decline was associated with an increase in O3 concentrations over the past decade. The findings suggest a need for review and refinement of emission control strategies in London, taking into account the complex relationship between NOx and O3.
