Here are five detailed paragraphs based on the scientific study provided:

**Paragraph 1**
Ozone (O3) pollution has emerged as a significant air pollutant in China over the past decade, particularly in the North China Plain (NCP). Effective ozone management in the NCP requires accurate estimation of surface ozone levels and identification of primary influencing factors. This study aims to develop an extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)-based ozone estimation model using ozone precursors such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and nitrogen oxides (NOX), meteorological data, land cover, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), terrain, and population data.

**Paragraph 2**
To develop the XGBoost-based ozone estimation model, this study utilized hourly ground-based ozone concentration observations from 235 ground stations of China's National Ground-Level Air Quality Observation Network. The study also used daily nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and formaldehyde (HCHO) data collected by the S5P satellite, along with a reanalysis dataset comprising NO2 profiles at 1000 hPa, HCHO total column densities, and NOX emissions from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) inventory spanning the years 2019 to 2021. The XGBoost algorithm was used to integrate these datasets and estimate surface ozone concentrations in the NCP.

**Paragraph 3**
The results of this study show that VOCs and NOX were the two main pollutants causing ozone pollution in the NCP, with relative contributions of more than 23.34% and 10.23%, respectively. HCHO also played a significant role, contributing over 5.64%. Meteorological factors contributed 28.63% to ozone pollution, with each individual factor contributing more than 2.38%. The spatial distribution of ozone pollution identified the Hebei-Shandong-Henan junction as a pollution hotspot, with peak ozone concentrations occurring in summer, particularly in June.

**Paragraph 4**
This study demonstrates the importance of considering both ozone precursors and meteorological factors in surface ozone estimation models. The results highlight the significance of VOCs and NOX emissions from industrial activities and vehicle exhaust as key contributors to ozone pollution in the NCP. The spatial distribution of ozone pollution shows that urban areas with dense population and high levels of industrial activity are hotspots for ozone pollution.

**Paragraph 5**
In conclusion, this study has developed an XGBoost-based ozone estimation model using a combination of ozone precursors, meteorological data, and land use information to estimate surface ozone concentrations in the North China Plain. The results show that VOCs and NOX emissions from industrial activities and vehicle exhaust are key contributors to ozone pollution in the region. The study provides valuable insights into the mechanisms of ozone production and the spatial distribution of ozone pollution in the NCP, which can inform targeted environmental protection policies to mitigate ozone pollution in this region.
