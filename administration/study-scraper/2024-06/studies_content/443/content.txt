Abstract
Objective
To overview the literature to answer the following question: “What is the performance of different therapies on wound healing and postoperative discomfort after palatal ASTG removal?”
Methods
SRs that evaluated the wound healing (WH), postoperative pain, bleeding, and analgesic consumption of patients submitted to de-epithelialized/free gingival grafts (FGG) or subepithelial connective tissue grafts (SCTG) removed from the palate were included. The searches were conducted on six white and two gray databases up to December 2023. Methodological quality was evaluated through AMSTAR 2. The synthesis of results was described as a narrative analysis.
Results
Ten SRs (involving 25 randomized clinical trials) related to low-level laser therapy (LLLT) (3), platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) (4), cyanoacrylate tissue adhesives (CTA) (2), and ozone therapy (OT) (1) were included in this overview. All techniques demonstrated improvements in WH. LLT, PRF, and CTA reduced pain and analgesic consumption. PRF and CTA reduced bleeding. Regarding methodological quality, the SRs were classified as critically low (2), low (5), moderate (2), or high quality (1).
Conclusions
In SRs related to LLLT, PRF, CTA, and OT, the use of different therapies after palatal ASTG removal improved WH and postoperative discomfort. Due to the studies’ low methodological quality and high heterogeneity, data should be interpreted with caution.
Clinical relevance
The present overview compiles the evidence of SRs related to different therapies for WH and patients’ postoperative experience and reveals that different treatments can significantly improve the clinical outcomes of patients who require ASTG removal for periodontal or peri-implant surgeries.
