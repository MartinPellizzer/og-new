This clinical study aimed to evaluate the effects of an anti-aging integrative therapy in 36 individuals. The treatment consisted of a combination of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT), ozone therapy, colon hydrotherapy, and multivitamins. Telomere length was used as a biomarker to objectively quantify the outcome of the treatment. Additionally, various aging symptoms were assessed before and after the treatment to evaluate its effectiveness.
