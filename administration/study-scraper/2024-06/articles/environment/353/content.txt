Here are five detailed paragraphs based on the scientific study:

**Paragraph 1**
Air pollution is a major threat to environmental health, and monitoring its levels is crucial in industrial areas where pollutants such as Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), Sulphur Dioxide (SO2), Ozone (O3), Formaldehyde (HCHO) and Carbon Monoxide (CO) are prevalent. Zonguldak province, known for its intense industrial activities, requires a thorough monitoring of air quality to mitigate the negative impacts on environmental health. This study aimed to monitor and analyze air quality in Zonguldak province using remote sensing techniques.

**Paragraph 2**
The Sentinel-5P TROPOMI satellite and Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform were used to determine air quality values in Zonguldak province between 2020 and 2022. The study employed a coding method to extract data on pollutant levels, including NO2, SO2, O3, HCHO and CO. Thematic maps and graphs were created using the obtained data, allowing for an analysis of air pollution patterns in the region.

**Paragraph 3**
The results showed that air pollution is intense in certain areas of Zonguldak province, particularly in EreÄŸli district and Filyos town. The study revealed high levels of NO2, SO2, O3, HCHO and CO concentrations in these regions, indicating a significant impact on environmental health. The findings suggest that these areas require urgent attention to mitigate the negative effects of industrial activities.

**Paragraph 4**
The analysis of air pollution patterns in Zonguldak province is crucial for understanding the potential environmental impacts of industrial activities. These findings can provide important clues for taking protective measures for environmental health and reducing the effects of industrial activities on the environment. The study highlights the importance of remote sensing techniques in monitoring and analyzing air quality, providing valuable insights for policymakers and environmental agencies.

**Paragraph 5**
In conclusion, this study demonstrates the effectiveness of remote sensing techniques in monitoring and analyzing air quality in Zonguldak province. The findings suggest that intense industrial activities in certain areas are leading to significant air pollution levels, which can have negative impacts on environmental health. Future studies should focus on developing strategies to mitigate these effects and improve air quality in the region.
