The results suggest that the pre-oxidation conditions at pH 2 are optimal for improving gold recovery. The lower gold dissolution observed in experiments performed without controlling the pH may be due to the formation of complex species or the deposition of metal ions on the mineral surface. Further studies are needed to investigate these possible causes and optimize the pre-oxidation process.
