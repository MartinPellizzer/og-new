The study's findings suggest that both natural processes and anthropogenic sources contribute to differences in pollutant concentrations between metropolitan regions. The correlations between pollutants and weather variables indicate that temperature and wind speed play important roles in shaping pollutant concentrations. However, the weak or nonsignificant correlations between VMT data and pollutants in Los Angeles suggest that other factors may be contributing to differences in pollutant concentrations.
