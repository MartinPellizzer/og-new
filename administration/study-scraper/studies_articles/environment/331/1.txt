In this study, two types of carbon fibre samples were prepared: one with size and the other without size. The samples were then treated with ozone in different conditions to modify their surfaces. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), atomic force microscopy (AFM), Raman spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to examine the changes in surface chemistry and morphology after ozonation.
