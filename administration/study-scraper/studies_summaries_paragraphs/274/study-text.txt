Here is a summary of the study in 1 detailed paragraph, focusing on the information and data related to ozone:

The review highlights recent advances in understanding plant responses to air pollution, with a focus on ozone (O3), nitrogen oxides (NOX), and particulate matter (PM). Ozone exposure induces stress responses similar to those triggered by other abiotic and biotic stresses, including activation of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-scavenging enzymes and hormone signaling pathways. New evidence suggests that antioxidant phenolic compound biosynthesis via the phenylpropanoids pathway plays a central role in air pollution stress responses, with transcription factors like WRKY, AP2/ERF, and MYB connecting hormone signaling to antioxidant biosynthesis. While laboratory studies have primarily focused on individual pollutants, the review emphasizes the need for comprehensive field studies and the identification of molecular tolerance traits to develop sustainable Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) for mitigating urban air pollution.
