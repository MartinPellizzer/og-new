Here are five detailed paragraphs based on the scientific study:

**Paragraph 1: Introduction**
Air pollution is a severe problem in China, with ozone (O3) pollution posing significant threats to public health and environmental sustainability. The Chinese government has implemented various policies to mitigate air pollution, including the environmental protection tax (EPT). This quasi-natural experiment-based study aims to investigate whether the implementation of EPT can reduce urban O3 pollution in China using panel data from 221 cities from 2015 to 2020.

**Paragraph 2: Methods**
The study employed a difference-in-differences (DID) model to analyze the impacts of EPT reform on O3 pollution. The EPT reform was used as a dummy variable, with values of 1 indicating improved standards in 2018 and subsequent years, and 0 otherwise. Logarithmic measurements were taken of the annual mean maximum eight-hour O3 concentration (M D A 8   O 3 ) to eliminate heteroscedasticity. The study controlled for other factors influencing air pollution, including energy consumption, industrial structure, and technological advances.

**Paragraph 3: Results**
The econometric results indicate that the EPT reform policy can effectively inhibit urban near-surface O3 pollution by approximately 2.1%. This result was confirmed through multiple robustness tests. Spatial heterogeneities of this control effect were captured, with better pollution reduction effects observed in inland cities and high-level financial cities.

**Paragraph 4: Discussion**
The study's findings suggest that the EPT reform policy can have a significant impact on reducing O3 pollution in China. The results also highlight the importance of considering regional characteristics when implementing environmental policies. The mechanisms underlying the impacts of EPT reform were explored, with evidence suggesting that reduced energy consumption, industrial structure optimization, and technological advances are relevant to the control effect.

**Paragraph 5: Conclusions**
This study provides empirical evidence for O3 pollution control in China and contributes to the further improvement of environmental protection policies. The findings suggest that the implementation of EPT can reduce urban O3 pollution, particularly in inland cities and high-level financial cities. The results highlight the importance of considering regional characteristics when implementing environmental policies and provide a realistic reference for O3 pollution control in China.
