The results revealed significant impacts on marine and terrestrial ecotoxicity as well as photochemical ozone formation. Midpoint, endpoint, and normalized analyses identified water, substrates, fertilizers, and energy sources as key contributors to the environmental burden. Notably, reclaimed water consistently demonstrated lower environmental impacts compared to conventional water across various indicators, including climate change (131 kg CO2 eq.), fine particulate matter formation (0.108 kg PM2.5 eq.), and freshwater consumption (0.291 m3).
