The analysis of IASI data provides valuable insights into the complex relationships between atmospheric phenomena and ozone trends. Sudden stratospheric warmings, for example, can disrupt the normal flow of air between the troposphere and stratosphere, leading to changes in total ozone distributions. Additionally, volcanic eruptions like the Hunga Tonga event can inject sulfate aerosols into the stratosphere, affecting ozone chemistry.
