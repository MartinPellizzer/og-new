Here is a summary of the study in one detailed paragraph, focusing on the information and data related to ozone:

This study evaluated the effectiveness of ozonation technology in reducing mycotoxin contamination in wheat products and by-products. The results showed that ozonation significantly reduced deoxynivalenol (DON) and zearalenone (ZEN) levels in whole wheat flour, wheat bran, and wet milling effluent. Specifically, DON degradation increased with processing time and moisture content, allowing for the production of products compliant with legal limits even starting from concentrations 2-4 times higher than allowed. Additionally, ozonation did not negatively impact phenolic compounds or antioxidant capacity, which is desirable from a nutritional perspective. The study also demonstrated that the ozonation process was effective in reducing DON and ZEN contamination in wheat bran, with faster degradation of ZEN compared to DON. Overall, the results suggest that ozonation technology can be an alternative for reducing mycotoxin contamination in wheat products and by-products.
