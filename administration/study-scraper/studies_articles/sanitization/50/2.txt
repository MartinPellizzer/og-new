The study found that the implementation of ozone/BAC pretreatment resulted in improved water quality, with TOC reduction achieved through chemical oxidation and biological growth. This led to reduced operating pressures and chemical use for membrane systems. The results showed that the ozone/BAC-MF-RO-UV/AOP treatment train provided a greater degree of public health protection compared to alternative treatment trains.
