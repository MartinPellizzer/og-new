Here is a summary of the study in 1 detailed paragraph, focusing on the information related to ozone:

Ozone, a natural substance composed of three oxygen atoms (O3), was used to oxidize wheat, corn, potato, and rice starches. The effects of ozone on the structure, physico-chemical, and microbiological properties of these starches were investigated. Ozone treatment for 1 hour at a rate of 60 g/h significantly affected the structure and color of corn and potato starch samples, with increased lightness, whiteness, and lower chroma values meeting consumer preferences. In contrast, rice starch showed high chroma, yellowness, and low whiteness values not adequate for consumer desire. Microbiological analysis revealed that ozone treatment reduced total bacteria and mold/yeast counts significantly (P < 0.05) in all starch samples due to the reduced pH of the samples.
