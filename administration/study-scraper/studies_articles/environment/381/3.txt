The findings of this study have significant implications for understanding the chemistry of atmospheric and combustion regimes. The results suggest that ozone plays a crucial role in initiating the oxidation of 1-hexene, leading to the formation of highly oxygenated organic molecules. This process has important consequences for air quality, as these molecules can contribute to the formation of secondary organic aerosols.
