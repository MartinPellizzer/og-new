Introduction (100 words)Bacterial infections and foodborne diseases pose significant global health threats. Ozone, derived from atmospheric oxygen, exhibits antimicrobial properties against various microorganisms, including bacteria and fungi. However, high concentrations of ozone gas can be harmful to humans. To address this issue, researchers have developed ultrafine bubble water (UFBW) technology, which generates nanoscale bubbles that exist in water for extended periods. This study investigates the effects of ozone UFBW on various bacterial toxins.
