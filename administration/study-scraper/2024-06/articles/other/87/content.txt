Here are five detailed paragraphs summarizing the scientific study:

**Paragraph 1: Introduction**
Air pollution is a significant environmental threat to human health worldwide, and its effects on systemic inflammation have not been fully characterized. Previous studies have shown that exposure to air pollution can lead to various adverse health outcomes, including cardiorespiratory and autoimmune diseases. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of short-term exposure to ambient air pollution on peripheral white blood cells and inflammatory biomarkers in a rural population.

**Paragraph 2: Methods**
The study recruited 5816 participants from rural villages in northern Henan Province, China. Trained investigators collected individual data using standardized questionnaires. Ambient air pollutant concentrations were obtained from the Xinxiang Environmental Monitoring Station, and peripheral blood biomarkers were measured using an automated hematology analyzer and clinical chemistry analyzer. The association between exposure to air pollution and meteorological factors was assessed using Spearman correlation analyses.

**Paragraph 3: Results**
The study found significant positive associations between PM2.5, CO, and WBC; CO, O3, and LYM; PM2.5, PM10, SO2, CO, and NEU; PM2.5, PM10, SO2, CO, and NLR; and hs-CRP. Negative associations were found between SO2 and WBC; PM2.5, PM10, NO2, CO, or O3 and EOS; PM2.5, SO2, or CO and BAS; SO2, NO2, or O3 and MON; and PM2.5, PM10, SO2, or NO2 and LYM. Moreover, men, individuals with normal BMI, current smokers, and those older than 60 years were found vulnerable to air pollution effects.

**Paragraph 4: Discussion**
The study provides insight into the potential mechanisms for air pollution-induced detrimental systemic effects in rural residents. The associations between air pollutant concentrations and peripheral white blood cells suggest that exposure to air pollution may stimulate the release of leukocytes and platelets into the circulation, leading to systemic inflammatory responses. The findings also highlight the importance of considering individual characteristics, such as sex, BMI, smoking status, and age, when evaluating the health effects of air pollution.

**Paragraph 5: Conclusion**
In conclusion, this study demonstrates that short-term exposure to ambient air pollution is associated with systemic inflammatory responses in a rural population. The findings provide evidence for the importance of considering individual characteristics and environmental factors when evaluating the health effects of air pollution. Further studies are needed to fully understand the mechanisms underlying these associations and to develop effective strategies for mitigating the adverse health impacts of air pollution.
