Here is a summary of the study in 1 detailed paragraph, focusing on ozone and related data:

The systematic review investigated the impact of meteorological factors and climate change on asthma, identifying 18 studies published between 2018 and 2022. The analysis revealed that extreme temperature fluctuations, humidity, wind speed, and exceptional weather events like hurricanes and heat waves were significantly linked to worsened asthmatic symptoms in children. Moreover, excessive concentrations of air pollutants, including ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and particles with an aerodynamic diameter lower than 2.5 Âµm (PM2.5), were associated with pediatric asthma emergency hospital admissions. Notably, the study highlighted a strong correlation between climate change and asthma in children, emphasizing the need for future research to quantify the impact of global climate change on aeroallergen distribution and air pollution levels, particularly ozone concentrations.
