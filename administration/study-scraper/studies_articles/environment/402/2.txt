Our findings indicate that UGS-BVOC emissions in Guangzhou amounted to 666.49 Gg, primarily from isoprene (ISOP) and terpenes (TERP). We found that these emissions contributed approximately 30% of urban ISOP concentrations and significantly reduced the underestimation of O3 simulations against observations. The model also showed improvements in simulation biases for NO2 and O3.
