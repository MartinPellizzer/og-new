**Paragraph 1**
The advanced treatment of dissolved organic matter (DOM) is a crucial step in wastewater recycling and membrane filtration water regeneration. Ozone-based advanced oxidation processes (O3-AOPs) are widely used for the removal of DOM and the control of membrane fouling. However, the processes and mechanisms of DOM removal and membrane fouling control for different O3-AOPs remain unclear, requiring further investigation.

**Paragraph 2**
The methods employed in this study included treating leather industry secondary effluent using O3-AOPs, including O3/UV/H2O2, O3/H2O2, and O3/UV. Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) was used to analyze the DOM transformation during treatment and its effect on membrane fouling.

**Paragraph 3**
The results showed that all three O3-AOPs achieved effective DOM removal, resulting in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) reduction from 14.0 mg/L to 6.8, 7.7, and 8.8 mg/L, respectively. The O3/UV process exhibited the highest potential for alleviating nanofiltration membrane fouling compared to the other processes.

**Paragraph 4**
The discussions revealed that O3-AOPs facilitate the removal of aromatic and protein-like compounds, enhancing oxygen content in the effluent. The fouling layer exhibited the lowest proportion of -COOH groups, a key factor in the formation of the gel layer. DOM was mainly concentrated in the low O/C region and composed of aliphatic compounds in O3/H2O2 effluent.

**Paragraph 5**
In conclusion, this study provides new perspectives and mechanism analysis for advanced treatment and membrane fouling control of leather industry secondary effluent. The results highlight the importance of selecting suitable O3-AOPs for efficient DOM removal and membrane fouling alleviation. Additionally, the findings suggest that O3/UV may be a promising process for treating leather wastewater while minimizing the formation of gel layers on nanofiltration membranes.
