The study's findings highlight the importance of considering the joint effects of PM2.5 and O3 on mortality, as coexposure to these pollutants may have synergistic or additive effects that are not captured by analyzing individual pollutants in isolation. The results also suggest that ignoring the interaction between these pollutants may lead to underestimations of attributable risks.
