The findings suggest that the O3/PMS process is effective in degrading TMAH in semiconductor wastewater. However, approximately 27% of nitrogen was converted to final by-products NH4+ and NO3-, indicating that considerable nitrogen fragments remained as intermediates. The proposed degradation pathways and intermediates were based on spectrometry data. Given the toxicity of demethylated intermediates being roughly 20-30 times lower than TMAH, acute toxicity to Artemia salina (A. fischeri) was reduced by approximately half.
