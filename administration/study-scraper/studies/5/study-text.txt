Abstract
This study refines the Bird model for forecasting solar radiation on oriented and inclined surfaces in Southern Tunisia, known for its high solar potential. Integrating the model into an Excel tool simplifies radiative transfer equations, enhancing solar forecast precision and accessibility. Over a decade of meteorological data enriches the model with atmospheric parameters like aerosol optical depth, water vapor content, and ozone thickness, extending its applicability across unmonitored regions. The improved model achieves coefficient of Determination (R²) values of 0.989 for Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI), 0.969 for Direct Horizontal Irradiance (DHI), and 0.974 for Diffuse Horizontal Irradiance (DifHI), with reduced Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values of 24.66 W/m² for GHI, 36.59 W/m² for DHI, and 12.66 W/m² for DifHI. Optimal panel inclinations are 40° to 60° in winter, 10° to 30° in summer, and 30° to 40° in spring and autumn for maximum solar energy capture. These findings enhance the understanding of solar dynamics in arid regions and support strategic solar energy deployment, offering a scalable framework for similar environments globally and promoting sustainable energy development.

, titled "Performance Metrics of the Bird Model for Solar Irradiance Prediction," offers a comprehensive analysis of the model's accuracy in predicting three types of solar irradiance: Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI), Direct Horizontal Irradiance (DHI), and Diffuse Horizontal Irradiance (DifHI). The data demonstrates that the model consistently overestimates the actual measurements, as evidenced by positive Mean Bias Error (MBE) values of 15.97 for GHI, 28.12 for DHI, and 9.66 for DifHI. Despite this overestimation, the model is considered notably acceptable due to its simplicity and ease of use, particularly in its implementation within an Excel tool. This user-friendly platform not only allows for quick analyses but also simplifies the integration and adaptation of the model into broader calculations for solar panel performance. The high R-squared values—0.989 for GHI, 0.969 for DHI, and 0.974 for DifHI—underscore the model's capability to capture a significant portion of the variance in observed solar irradiance data. Furthermore, although the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) suggest that there is potential for improvement, the current level of accuracy is adequate for practical applications.

Comparison with existing forecasting models
The adapted Bird model offers distinct advantages over traditional empirical models and advanced Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models, particularly in arid settings. Empirical models such as those developed by Angström
[46]
and Hargreaves and Samani
[47]
often falter under unpredictable weather conditions. Advanced NWP models, including the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model
[48]
and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) model
[49]
, demand extensive computational resources. More recent models like the Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) forecast model by Perez et al.
[50]
and the Solar and Moon Position Algorithm (SAMPA) by Reda and Andreas
[51]
also have limitations in specific applications. In contrast, the Bird model maintains high accuracy with far greater efficiency. Its integration into an Excel tool simplifies the forecasting process, enhancing accessibility and cost-effectiveness. This makes the Bird model especially suitable for regions like Southern Tunisia, where it can optimize solar energy systems under challenging environmental conditions.
Enhancing global applicability
While demonstrating high accuracy in Tataouine, the Bird model's broader applicability to other arid climates remains to be empirically tested. Its adjustable parameters such as aerosol optical depth, atmospheric moisture content, and solar declination suggest potential for wider geographic use. Future research is necessary to verify these capabilities and potentially extend the model’s utility to global renewable energy projects.
Application to oriented and inclined surfaces
In adapting the R.E. Bird Clear Sky Broadband Solar Radiation Model for inclined and oriented surfaces, sophisticated geometric modeling was integrated with empirical data to ensure precise estimation of solar irradiance, critical for optimizing solar panel installations in varied environmental conditions.
This adaptation involves trigonometric calculations that account for the influence of the orientation (angle relative to the south, γ) and inclination (tilt angle from the horizontal, θ) on solar irradiance, considering the solar elevation angle (h) and azimuth angle (α). These calculations are crucial in determining the amount of solar radiation a surface receives under specific geometrical configurations.
Solar irradiance for each surface configuration is calculated using dynamic equations using the following equations, as adapted from Al-Rawahi et al.
[46]
, that adjust to changes in the solar position and surface geometry
(24)
(25)
These formulas ensure precise predictions across a range of conditions.
Model calibration employs a dual-data approach: Local meteorological data continuously collected from ground-based stations in Tataouine provides foundational parameters for initial setups and ongoing recalibrations, while satellite-derived atmospheric data from sources like NASA’s Earth Observations and the European Space Agency’s Copernicus program offer high-resolution atmospheric composition metrics to adjust the model for broader climatic variations.
The equations from
Eq.1 to Eq
.25, while theoretically robust, are simplified through their implementation in an Excel framework, allowing for efficient processing of data and immediate application to solar panel installations. This methodology provides solar energy project planners with a valuable tool for optimizing the placement and angling of solar panels in Tataouine and similar environments, enhancing the overall efficiency and energy yield of solar power systems.

Results and discussions
Detailed seasonal variations in solar radiation
This comprehensive study meticulously investigates how the orientation and inclination of solar panels influence direct solar radiation across critical solar events—namely, the solstices and equinoxes. This analysis highlights the need for adaptive configurations to optimize energy capture. During the Winter Solstice, it is crucial to increase the inclination angle to between 40° and 60° to maximize solar gain due to the sun's lower trajectory during the shortest days of the year, as shown in
Fig. 8
. This strategic adjustment not only enhances energy absorption when panels are oriented towards the azimuth and directly south but also aligns with the solar thermal process principles outlined by Duffie and Beckman
[52]
. For the equinoxes, where the sun's path is evenly distributed, setting panel inclinations close to 30° to 40° optimizes radiation absorption, effectively capturing solar radiation during these transitional periods as depicted in
Fig. 9
,
Fig. 11
. Conversely, during the Summer Solstice, reducing the inclination angles to between 10° and 30° allows panels to capture the maximum amount of intense sunlight by aligning more directly with the high sun path, enhancing panel efficiency as demonstrated in
Fig. 10
. The effectiveness of these angular adjustments, critical for maximizing solar capture, is well-supported by references
[53]

[56]
, emphasizing the critical role of receiver orientation and inclination in maximizing solar energy capture. The adapted Bird model, now incorporating parameters for atmospheric dust and elevated temperatures, provides more accurate forecasts, reflecting the environmental impacts on panel performance. By adjusting panel orientation and inclination according to seasonal solar trajectories, solar power systems in arid environments like Southern Tunisia can achieve significantly enhanced efficiency, optimizing solar energy systems to exploit the region's high solar potential while addressing local environmental challenges.

Horizontal direct irradiation variability
The observed variability in horizontal direct irradiation through inclined surfaces across different seasons underscores the critical need for adaptable solar panel configurations. These adjustments are vital to compensate for the significant seasonal shifts in solar elevation and intensity, which directly affect the efficiency of photovoltaic (PV) systems. This dynamic is thoroughly analyzed in the work of Huld (2012)
[57]
,
[58]
and Huld et al. (2022)
[59]
, who provide extensive insights into how solar radiation variations impact PV performance. Their studies highlight the complexities introduced by geographical differences, as they examine solar irradiation trends not only across various European locales but also in diverse African regions. These findings suggest that the adaptability in panel orientation and inclination is not merely a technical requirement but a strategic necessity to harness maximum solar potential effectively. By understanding and implementing these variable setups, solar energy systems can maintain optimal performance throughout the year, adapting to the natural solar fluxes dictated by Earth's axial tilt and orbital position. Such knowledge is crucial for designing systems that are both efficient and resilient, capable of adjusting to the changing patterns of solar exposure that vary not only by season but also by geographic location.
Strategic orientation for enhanced solar capture
An in-depth analysis focusing on the optimal orientation of solar receivers is essential for harnessing the maximum potential of solar energy, particularly during seasonal extremes. The studies, illustrated in
Fig. 12
, provide a visual representation of hourly direct solar radiation on variably oriented surfaces during two critical points in Earth's orbit: Perihelion Day (a), when the Earth is closest to the sun, and Aphelion Day (b), when it is farthest. These periods represent extreme solar conditions, and the data collected offer invaluable insights into how various orientations can affect the efficiency of solar capture throughout the year.

- Winter Orientation: Angling solar panels between 45° and 60° is most effective. This orientation leverages the low solar altitude and the shorter daylight hours of winter months. By tilting toward these specific angles, solar receivers can capture the most direct sunlight available, significantly enhancing energy yield during a period when solar resources are naturally reduced.
- Summer Orientation: Aligning panels directly south (γ=0) is optimal during the summer. This orientation aligns perfectly with the sun’s path at its zenith—its highest and longest journey across the sky. Such strategic positioning is crucial for maximizing solar exposure during the longest days of the year. This approach is supported by Lorenzo (1994)
[60]
, who emphasizes the benefits of south-facing panels for maximizing energy capture under conditions of a high sun path.
This strategic approach to the orientation of solar panels, guided by empirical data and reinforced by established solar energy research, underscores the importance of adapting solar infrastructure to natural variations in solar trajectory. By optimizing panel orientations to align with seasonal and astronomical variations, solar energy systems can achieve significantly higher efficiency, ensuring that energy production is optimized year-round, despite the inherent variability in solar exposure.
Comprehensive design recommendations
The integration of these detailed seasonal and orientation insights into the design and deployment of solar energy systems is vital for maximizing system efficiency. By implementing adjustable inclination and orientation mechanisms, solar energy systems can dynamically adapt to seasonal changes, significantly enhancing both efficiency and energy yield. Such optimized design principles are essential for improving solar installation performance and promoting greater energy independence and sustainability.
This approach is supported by Makrides et al. (2010)
[5]
, who discuss performance loss rates of different photovoltaic technologies under outdoor conditions, highlighting the importance of adapting system designs to environmental conditions for sustained efficiency.
These findings, grounded in established research and aligned with international best practices, advocate for a nuanced approach to solar energy system design that responds dynamically to natural variations in solar radiation throughout the year. By incorporating these principles into system configurations, higher efficiency and more sustainable energy solutions in the field of solar energy are achievable.
To mitigate the adverse effects of high temperatures and dust accumulation observed in the study, the implementation of regular cleaning schedules for solar panels and the consideration of cooling technologies are recommended. Additionally, installing solar panels at optimal angles can reduce dust accumulation and exposure to excessive heat, thus maintaining higher efficiency levels. Also, it is critical to highlight the economic and environmental benefits derived from the application of accurate solar radiation forecasting in Southern Tunisia. The integration of advanced forecasting tools like Excel not only supports the technical optimization of solar power systems but also promotes broader economic growth and environmental sustainability. These benefits are essential for securing a sustainable future and fostering a resilient energy sector in arid regions.
Conclusion
This study has markedly advanced solar radiation forecasting by tailoring the Bird model to the specific environmental conditions of Tataouine, Southern Tunisia. This was achieved by utilizing over a decade of meteorological data and meticulously calibrating the model to local atmospheric factors such as aerosol levels, water vapor content, and ozone variations, thereby achieving a substantial improvement in the accuracy of solar irradiance predictions for arid regions. The empirical results showed a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) reduction to 24.66 W/m² for Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI), 36.59 W/m² for Direct Horizontal Irradiance (DHI), and 12.66 W/m² for Diffuse Horizontal Irradiance (DifHI), along with high Coefficient of Determination (R²) values of 0.989 for GHI, 0.969 for DHI, and 0.974 for DifHI.
The implementation of the Euxel tool, which simplifies the utilization of the Bird model while maintaining its accuracy, has proven to be a significant advancement. This tool makes advanced forecasting technologies accessible to a broader audience, from engineers to energy managers, enhancing the deployment of solar energy solutions. The introduction of optimal panel inclinations—40° to 60° during winter, 10° to 30° in summer, and 30° to 40° during spring and autumn—optimizes solar capture in line with Tataouine’s specific solar geometry.
The successful application in Tataouine indicates that similar methodologies can be applied effectively in other arid regions globally, potentially enhancing the efficiency and deployment of renewable energy solutions. This study underscores the importance of region-specific adaptations in solar radiation models and illustrates how technological advancements can help overcome barriers to renewable energy adoption, aligning with global energy sustainability goals. Moving forward, further research should explore the integration of additional environmental variables and new data sources to refine the accuracy and applicability of solar irradiance forecasts in diverse geographical settings.
