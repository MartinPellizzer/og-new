The researchers used more than forty years of space-based observations of solar irradiance and multiple geophysical quantities to develop models that simulate the Sun's magnetic activity cycles. These models were constructed using current observations and extended into both the past and future to quantify the Sun's role in global climate change, ozone-depletion, and recovery, as well as space environment climatology.
