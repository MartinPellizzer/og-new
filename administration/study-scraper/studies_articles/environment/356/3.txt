The study's findings have significant implications for wildfire management and air quality planning. For instance, the results suggest that refined definitions of dry lightning based on local topography, vegetation, and climate are necessary to improve wildfire ignition predictions. Additionally, the CNN-based predictive models developed in this study can be used to project future lightning and lightning-caused wildfires, enabling more informed decision-making.
