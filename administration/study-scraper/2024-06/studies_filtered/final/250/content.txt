TCSIF: a temporally consistent global Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2A (GOME-2A) solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence dataset with the correction of sensor degradation
Chu Zou, Shanshan Du, Xinjie Liu, and Liangyun Liu
Abstract
Satellite-based solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) serves as a valuable proxy for monitoring the photosynthesis of vegetation globally. The Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2A (GOME-2A) SIF product has gained widespread popularity, particularly due to its extensive global coverage since 2007. However, serious temporal degradation of the GOME-2A instrument is a problem, and there is currently a lack of time-consistent GOME-2A SIF products that meet the needs of temporal trend analysis. In this paper, the GOME-2A instrument's temporal degradation was first calibrated using a pseudo-invariant method, which revealed 16.21 % degradation of the GOME-2A radiance at the near-infrared (NIR) band from 2007 to 2021. Based on the calibration results, the temporal degradation of the GOME-2A radiance spectra was successfully corrected by using a fitted quadratic polynomial function whose determination coefficient (R2) was 0.851. Next, a data-driven algorithm was applied for SIF retrieval at the 735–758 nm window. Also, a photosynthetically active radiation (PAR)-based upscaling model was employed to upscale the instantaneous clear-sky observations to monthly average values to compensate for the changes in cloud conditions and atmospheric scattering. Accordingly, a global temporally consistent GOME-2A SIF dataset (TCSIF) for 2007 to 2021 with the correction of temporal degradation was successfully generated, and the spatiotemporal pattern of global SIF was then investigated. Corresponding trend maps of the global temporally consistent GOME-2A SIF showed that 62.91 % of vegetated regions underwent an increase in SIF, and the global annual averaged SIF exhibited a trend of increasing by 0.70 % yr−1 during the 2007–2021 period. The TCSIF dataset is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8242928 (Zou et al., 2023).

1 Introduction
Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) retrieved from satellite-based hyperspectral data provides a new way to proxy the photosynthesis of vegetation globally. Numerous studies have demonstrated that satellite-based SIF observations are able to produce better estimates of gross primary productivity (GPP) than the widely used reflectance-based approaches (Sun et al., 2017; Guanter et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2014).
Currently, the satellite sensors used for SIF retrieval can be generally divided into two types according to their spectral resolution (Frankenberg et al., 2011, 2014; Guanter et al., 2012; Du et al., 2018). The first type of satellite was originally designed to measure the atmospheric XCO2 concentration using observations with a spectral resolution of higher than 0.05 nm; these satellites include GOSAT (Frankenberg et al., 2011; Guanter et al., 2012), OCO-2 (Frankenberg et al., 2014; Sun et al., 2017), TanSat (Du et al., 2018), and OCO-3 (Taylor et al., 2020). The other type of satellite instrument was originally designed for atmospheric chemistry applications and had a spectral resolution of about 0.5 nm. Instruments of this type included the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment 2 (GOME-2) on board the MetOp-A/B/C satellites (Joiner et al., 2013, 2016; Köhler et al., 2015), the SCanning Imaging Absorption spectroMeter for Atmospheric CHartograhY (SCIAMACHY) on board the ENVIronmental SATellite (ENVISAT) (Köhler et al., 2015; Joiner et al., 2016), and the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) on board the Sentinel-5P satellite (Köhler et al., 2018). Given that its global coverage capability starts from 2007, the GOME-2 satellite-based SIF dataset has been the most widely used for the global monitoring of GPP, crop yields, droughts, and vegetation phenology (Sun et al., 2015; Guanter et al., 2014; Yoshida et al., 2015; Lu et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2019). Yet, the volatile coating used within GOME-2's optical bench enclosure makes the optical lens more susceptible to contamination, which eventually leads to instrument degradation (Hahne, 2012; Munro et al., 2016). Further, such degradation may affect the solar and Earth radiance measurements in different ways, depending on the optical components involved, and correcting this via the onboard calibration method may be impossible (Munro et al., 2016). Moreover, how degradation impacts the quality of different level-2 products is highly dependent on the individual algorithms used. Generally, there is a strong decreasing trend in the GOME-2A level-2 SIF product as derived from the GOME-2A level-1B radiance product. For example, the GOME-2A SIF generated by Joiner et al. (2016) and the Sun-Induced Fluorescence of Terrestrial Ecosystems Retrieval (SIFTER) SIF dataset produced by Sanders et al. (2016) were both found to harbor an artificial trend caused by instrument degradation (Zhang et al., 2018; Koren et al., 2018). Also, Yang et al. (2018) reported that the SIF emission of the Amazon forests decreased during the 2015/2016 El Niño event when analyzed by Joiner et al. (2016) using the GOME-2 SIF data, which is in conflict with the increases in the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and downward solar shortwave radiation. Zhang et al. (2018) argued that the reduced GOME-2A SIF signal observed by Yang et al. (2018) in the Amazon forest could have been caused by artifacts associated with the temporal degradation of the GOME-2A instrument instead of an actual decline in photosynthesis. Hence, it is imperative to address the temporally decreasing artifact in the GOME-2A dataset before this dataset is applied to any analysis and interpretation of interannual trends.
Researchers have tried to generate consistent long-term SIF datasets. For example, Wang et al. (2022) assembled a consistent long-term global SIF dataset (LT_SIFc*) by combining the global SIF products from GOME, SCIAMACHY, and GOME-2. The temporal degradation problem was corrected based on the satellite SIF measurements over the Sahara between 1995 and 2018. Unfortunately, this attempt was not sufficiently rigorous in that the degradation of sensors does not transit to SIF in a linear manner due to post-processing processes. Furthermore, LT_SIFc* is a reprocessed product derived from existing GOME-2 SIF products, which limits its temporal resolution to 1 month and hinders its broader application. Earlier, van Schaik et al. (2020) applied a seasonal factor to GOME-2 reflectance and retrieved SIF from that temporally corrected reflectance data to generate the SIFTER v2 product; however, the function fitted with the season as the smallest unit may entail deviations from the actual reality of sensor degradation. Accordingly, in terms of the processing results, significant interannual variation persists in the SIFTER v2 time series (Wang et al., 2022). Presently, we still lack a robust, consistent long-term GOME-2 SIF product that has been generated via rigorous recalibration methods and can yield reasonable, meaningful results. This leaves the long-term observations provided by GOME-2 underutilized scientifically.
The objective of this study was to provide a temporally consistent GOME-2A SIF dataset spanning 2007 to 2021 that overcomes the degradation problem. The temporal degradation of GOME-2A level-1B radiance was first calibrated using the pseudo-invariant method in the Sahara. Then a data-driven approach was applied to retrieve the SIF datasets from the corrected GOME-2A measurements. Finally, a global temporally consistent monthly GOME-2A SIF (TCSIF) dataset for 2007–2021 was generated, using the photosynthetically active radiation (PAR)-based temporal upscaling method, from the degradation-corrected GOME-2A instantaneous SIF retrievals. The temporally consistent GOME-2A SIF dataset generated here offers a promising tool for monitoring global vegetation variation from 2007 through 2021, and it will advance our understanding of the photosynthetic activity of vegetation at a global scale.
2 Datasets
2.1 Datasets for the generation of TCSIF
GOME-2A (launched on 19 October 2006) was designed by the European Space Agency to measure atmospheric ozone, trace gases, and ultraviolet radiation. Since 2007, it has been collecting top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance data spanning the spectral range of 270 to 790 nm from four channels (Munro et al., 2006). Of these, channel 4 of GOME-2A has a spectral (wavelength) coverage of 593–790 nm with a spectral resolution of 0.48 nm and was successfully used to generate a global SIF dataset (Joiner et al., 2013).
The MODIS version 6.1 Nadir Bidirectional reflectance distribution Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR) product (MCD43C4) (Schaaf et al., 2002) records the surface reflectance at the nadir viewing angle for each pixel at local solar noon. It has a spatial resolution of 0.05° × 0.05° and daily temporal resolution (Schaaf et al., 2002). The MODIS NBAR product is considered stable over long periods of time and was used here to investigate the homogeneity and stability of the calibration site (see Sect. 3.1).
The EVI product derived from the MODIS Vegetation Indices 16-Day (MOD13C1) version 6.1, with a spatial resolution of 0.05°, was aggregated to 0.5° (Didan, 2021). PAR was obtained from the MERRA-2 meteorological assimilation reanalysis data (Gelaro et al., 2017), and this PAR dataset had a spatial resolution of 0.5° × 0.625° (resampled to 0.5° × 0.5°) and a temporal interval of 1 h. The EVI product and MERRA-2 PAR dataset were used to upscale the instantaneous SIF to monthly values, as described in Sect. 3.4.
2.2 Datasets for evaluation and comparison
The dataset was verified through a two-step verification, i.e., the verification of the corrected radiance (compared to radiance measurements in the absence of sensor degradation) and SIF retrievals (compared to other long-term products).
Radiance spectra obtained from GOME-2C serve as a benchmark for the calibrated GOME-2A radiance. Although it is a sensor that measures the same bands with the same spectral resolution as GOME-2A, GOME-2C had a later launch time (in November 2018). Thus, measurements obtained at the initial launch stage of GOME-2C can be taken as accurate values that are not affected by degradation.
The NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) and three global GPP products were utilized for validation purposes. We employed the global NDVI derived from the MOD13C1 product. The MOD17A2H GPP (MODIS GPP) product, with a spatial resolution of 500 m (Running et al., 2021), was mosaicked globally every 8 d during the 2007–2021 period. The global simulated GPP based on the LUE model (Pmodel GPP) is a daily product from 1982 to 2016 whose spatial resolution is 0.5° (Stocker et al., 2019). The monthly 0.5° GPP derived from the Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (DGVM) for 2007 to 2021 was also utilized (TRENDY GPP version 11) (Sitch et al., 2015). The temporal range, temporal resolution, and spatial resolution of these datasets are summarized in Table 1. All these products were resampled at a spatial resolution of 0.5° and a temporal resolution of 1 month to enable their comparison.

Next, we selected four long-term SIF products spanning more than 1 decade for comparison, including the LT_SIFc* (1995–2018) (Wang et al., 2022), SIFTER v2 (2007–2018) (van Schaik et al., 2020), GOSIF (2000–2022) (Li and Xiao, 2019), and GOME-2 SIF products generated by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (hereon abbreviated to NASA SIF) (2007–2018) (Joiner et al., 2013, 2016). The LT_SIFc* is a data fusion product of GOME, SCIAMACHY, and GOME-2 with a spatial resolution of 0.05° and a temporal resolution of 1 month. It dealt with the temporal decay of the instrument based on statistics of the SIF signals in the Sahara. The SIFTER v2 product is the point-by-point SIF product retrieved from GOME-2 measurements after applying a time-related correction factor; it was composited to yield a monthly 0.5° global map in this study. The GOSIF product is the spatiotemporal extrapolation product based on the global neural network model and the OCO-2 SIF V8r product, with a spatial resolution of 0.05° and a temporal resolution of 8 d. Apart from the SIF products spanning decades, the OCO-2 SIF product from 2015 to 2021 and the TROPOMI SIF from 2018 to 2021 are also included here for comparative purposes due to their high accuracy and because they are less affected by sensor degradation. All SIF products were resampled to 0.5° spatial and monthly temporal resolution and were compared with TCSIF to assess long-term trends in
