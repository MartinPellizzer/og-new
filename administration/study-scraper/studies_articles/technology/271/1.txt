The methods employed in this study included the construction of an electrocoagulation reactor and ozonation tank with operating factors such as current intensity (I), treatment time (T), and ozone concentration O3. The raw sample was treated with electrocoagulation alone, while another sample was treated with electrocoagulation followed by ozonation. The bioassay tests were conducted using Lactuca sativa L. lettuce seeds to assess the toxicity parameters of absolute germination (AG), germination index (GI), and average inhibition concentration (EC50).
