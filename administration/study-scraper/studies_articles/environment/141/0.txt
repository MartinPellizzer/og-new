The recovery of the ozone layer after the implementation of the Montreal Protocol and its amendments has been a topic of great interest in recent years. Understanding the long-term changes in stratospheric ozone time series is crucial to assessing the effectiveness of these regulations. In this study, researchers analyzed observational records from various sources, including NOAA's Dobson Network via the Umkehr method, ozonesondes, and the NOAA COHesive SBUV/OMPS satellite-based record (COH), to evaluate stratospheric ozone profile trends.
