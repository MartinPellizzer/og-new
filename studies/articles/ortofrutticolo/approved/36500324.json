    "abstract": "Red currant fruits are a valuable source of micro- and macronutrients, vitamins, and chemical compounds with health-promoting properties, the properties of which change depending on the harvest date and the time and method of storage. This study analysed the effect of applying 10 ppm ozone gas for 15 and 30 min on the mechanical properties, chemical properties and microbiological stability of three organic-grown red currant fruit cultivars. Fruits harvested at the time of harvest maturity had significantly larger diameters and weights and lower water contents compared with fruits harvested seven days earlier, and the ozonation process, regardless of its harvesting date, reduced the physical parameters in question (diameter, weight, and water content). The ascorbic acid content of the ozonated fruit varied, with the highest decreases observed for fruit harvested 7 days before the optimal harvest date and stored for 15 days under refrigeration (an average decrease of 13.31% compared with the control fruit without ozonation). In general, the ozonation process had a positive effect on the variation of fruit antioxidant activity, with the highest average values obtained for fruit harvested 7 days before the optimum harvest date and stored for 15 days under refrigeration conditions; in addition, it also had an effect on reducing the development of microorganisms, including mesophilic aerobic bacteria, yeasts, and moulds, mainly for the cultivar 'Losan'."
