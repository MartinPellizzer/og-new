The results of this study showed that ozonation significantly modified the surface chemistry of both desized and sized carbon fibres. XPS analysis revealed an increase in hydroxyl and carboxyl functional groups, which are essential for interfacial bonding with the matrix. The Raman spectroscopy analysis indicated an escalation in graphite regions during the ozonation process. Mechanical test results showed that ozone treatment increased the interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) of both desized and sized carbon fibres.
