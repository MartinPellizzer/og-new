The results showed that extreme variations in temperature, humidity, wind speed, exceptional incidents like hurricanes, cold and heat waves, and seasonal shifts were strongly correlated with the worsening of asthmatic symptoms, particularly in childhood. In addition, excessive concentrations of air pollutants and aeroallergens were linked to pediatric asthma emergency hospital admissions.
