The updated AQM version 7 (AQMv7) is coupled with a "state-of-the-science" CMAQ version 5.4, which includes improvements in gas and aerosol chemistry, dry deposition processes, and structural changes to the Input/Output (IO) interface. A simulation was conducted for the period of August 2023 to assess the effects of these updates on the forecast performance of ozone (O3) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5), two major air pollutants over the continental United States (CONUS). The updated model was evaluated using metrics such as mean bias, root-mean-square error, and correlation coefficient.
