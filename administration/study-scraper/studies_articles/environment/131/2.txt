The results showed that the highest VOC concentrations were recorded at the Marylebone and Eltham sites, with values of 29.7±14.9 and 16.3 ± 10.5 µg m-3, respectively. Ethane (C₂H₆) and propane (C₃H₈) showed higher OFP values at Marylebone Road, indicating that emissions from vehicles and industries have a greater impact on the reactivity of these compounds. The contribution of ethane to ozone formation ranged from 4% in Eltham to 8% in Chilbolton.
