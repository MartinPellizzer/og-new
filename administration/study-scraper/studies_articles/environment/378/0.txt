The removal of acid dyes from industrial effluents is a significant environmental concern due to their toxic and carcinogenic properties. Among various acid dyes, Acid Blue 113 has been identified as a highly persistent pollutant in water bodies. To address this issue, researchers have explored different methods for the removal of acid dyes from wastewater, including photocatalytic ozonation. This process combines the advantages of photocatalysis and ozonation to achieve efficient dye degradation. In this study, a novel magnesium oxide-based nanocatalyst was synthesized and used in photocatalytic ozonation to remove Acid Blue 113 dye.
