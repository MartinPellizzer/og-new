**Paragraph 1: Introduction**
Ozone (O3) pollution is a significant environmental concern globally. In China, O3 concentrations have increased rapidly in recent years, posing risks to human health and ecosystems. Understanding the characteristics of O3 pollution and its correlations with meteorological factors is crucial for developing effective strategies to mitigate this issue. This study focuses on examining the surface O3 pollution and its relationships with meteorological factors in Xiangtan, China.

**Paragraph 2: Methods**
The research employed a combination of O3 monitoring data from 2020-2022 and meteorological observation data for Xiangtan. Daily maximum 8-hour average O3 concentrations were analyzed to identify trends and correlations with temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and dominant wind directions. The ozone and temperature change response slope (KO3-T) was used to assess the effects of local emissions on O3 generation.

**Paragraph 3: Results**
The study found significant increases in daily maximum 8-hour average O3 concentrations in Xiangtan during the period considered. Notable seasonal variations were also observed, with higher concentrations during the summer months. The analysis revealed that at temperatures below 27°C, O3-8h concentration increased almost linearly with increasing temperature. At temperatures between 27-37°C, it showed an upward curvilinear trend, and above 37°C, it decreased with increasing temperature.

**Paragraph 4: Discussion**
The results indicate that local emissions had no significant effect on O3-8h generation, suggesting that long-range transport of pollutants plays a crucial role in Xiangtan's O3 pollution. The study also highlights the importance of meteorological factors, particularly temperature and relative humidity, in modulating O3 concentrations. The findings have implications for developing targeted strategies to mitigate O3 pollution in Xiangtan and other regions with similar characteristics.

**Paragraph 5: Conclusions**
In conclusion, this study provides valuable insights into the characteristics of surface O3 pollution and its correlations with meteorological factors in Xiangtan, China. The results emphasize the need for a comprehensive approach to address O3 pollution, involving both local emissions reduction and long-range transport mitigation strategies. Further research is warranted to explore the applicability of these findings to other regions and to develop effective policies for addressing O3 pollution in China.
