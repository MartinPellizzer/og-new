The researchers used CESM2-WACCM6, a chemistry climate model, to simulate the atmospheric circulation and composition of TRAPPIST-1e. The model was configured with an initial Earth-like atmospheric composition and an assumption of tidally locked rotation. The orography of the planet was modeled using Earth-like landmasses, with the substellar point located over the Pacific Ocean. The Helmholtz wind decomposition and meridional mass streamfunction were used to analyze the atmospheric circulation.
