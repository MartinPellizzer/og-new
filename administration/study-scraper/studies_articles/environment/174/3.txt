The findings suggest that Ozone MNBs treatment affects the substance and enzyme activity of synthesizing and decomposing of chlorophyll, leading to inhibition of "green" in soybean sprouts. The enhanced activities of enzymes involved in chlorophyll degradation may play a key role in regulating chlorophyll synthesis. Furthermore, the decreased levels of precursors in chlorophyll synthesis indicate that Ozone MNBs treatment may also affect the early stages of chlorophyll biosynthesis.
