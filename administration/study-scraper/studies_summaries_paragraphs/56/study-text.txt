Here is a summary of the study in 1 detailed paragraph, focusing on the information and data related to ozone:

The joint effect of short-term exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone (O3) on mortality was investigated in this time series study conducted in 272 Chinese cities from 2013-2015. The results showed that high levels of O3 significantly increased the risk of total nonaccidental mortality, with a 1.26% increase per 10 Î¼g/m3 increase in O3 exposure when PM2.5 levels were high, compared to 0.59% at low PM2.5 levels. Additionally, the synergistic effect of coexposure to PM2.5 and O3 was found to be statistically significant, with a relative excess risk of interaction (RERI) of 0.69% and a synergy index (SI) of 1.31. Moreover, the study found that nonaccidental deaths attributable to short-term exposure to PM2.5 or O3 were higher when considering modification by the other pollutant, with increases of 28% and 31%, respectively. These findings suggest underestimations of attributable risks without considering the synergistic effects of coexposure to PM2.5 and O3 on mortality.
