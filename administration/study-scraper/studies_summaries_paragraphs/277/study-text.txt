Here is a summary of the study in one detailed paragraph focusing on ozone (O3) related data:

The study examined the associations between short-term exposure to wildfire-related O3 and daily all-cause, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality across 749 locations in 43 countries or areas globally. The researchers estimated population-weighted exposure to wildfire-related O3 using a chemical transport model, validated against ground monitoring data, and downscaled to a resolution of 0·25° × 0·25° (approximately 28 km2 at the equator). They found that an increase of 1 μg/m3 in the mean daily concentration of wildfire-related O3 during lag 0–2 days was associated with increases of 0·55% (95% CI 0·29 to 0·80) in daily all-cause mortality, 0·44% (-0·10 to 0·99) in daily cardiovascular mortality, and 0·82% (0·18 to 1·47) in daily respiratory mortality. The associations showed substantial geographical heterogeneity at the country and regional levels, with the highest maximum daily wildfire-related O3 concentrations observed in locations in South America, central America, and southeastern Asia, as well as in South Africa. Across all locations, estimated annual excess mortality fractions of 0·58% (95% CI 0·31 to 0·85; 31 606 deaths [95% CI 17 038 to 46 027]) for all-cause mortality, 0·41% (-0·10 to 0·91; 5249 [-1244 to 11 620]) for cardiovascular mortality, and 0·86% (0·18 to 1·51; 4657 [999 to 8206]) for respiratory mortality were attributable to short-term exposure to wildfire-related O3.
