Abstract     
Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) have been extensively studied because of their significant roles as precursors of atmospheric ozone and secondary organic aerosol pollution. The research aims to comprehend the current advancements in domestic and international VOC emission accounting. The study utilized the CiteSpace software to represent the pertinent material from Web of Science visually. The hot spots and future development trends of VOC emission calculation are analyzed from the perspectives of thesis subject words, cooperative relationships, co-citation relationships, journals, and core papers. According to the statistics, the approaches most often employed in VOC accounting between 2013 and 2023 are source analysis and emission factor method. Atmospheric environment is the journal with the most publications in the area. The Chinese Academy of Sciences and the University of Colorado System are prominent institutions in VOC emission accounting research, both domestically and internationally. The primary research focuses on the realm of VOC emission accounting clusters, which are “emission factor,” “source analysis,” “model,” “air quality,” and “health.” A current trend in VOC emission accounting involves the construction of a VOC emission inventory using a novel model that combines emission factors and source analysis. This study reviews the progress made in calculating volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions over the past decade. It aims to provide researchers with a new perspective to promote the development of this field.
