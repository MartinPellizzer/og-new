Abstract
Nowadays, a stack of heavily doped polysilicon (poly-Si) and tunnel oxide (SiOx) is widely employed to improve the passivation performance in n-type tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) silicon solar cells. In this case, it is critical to develop an in-line advanced fabrication process capable of producing high-quality tunnel SiOx. Herein, an in-line ozone-gas oxidation (OGO) process to prepare the tunnel SiOx is proposed to be applied in n-type TOPCon solar cell fabrication, which has obtained better performance compared with previously reported in-line plasma-assisted N2O oxidation (PANO) process. In order to explore the underlying mechanism, the electrical properties of the OGO and PANO tunnel SiOx are analyzed by deep-level transient spectroscopy technology. Notably, continuous interface states in the band gap are detected for OGO tunnel SiOx, with the interface state densities (Dit) of 1.2 × 1012–3.6 × 1012 cm−2 eV−1 distributed in Ev + (0.15–0.40) eV, which is significantly lower than PANO tunnel SiOx. Furthermore, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis indicate that the percentage of SiO2 (Si4+) in OGO tunnel SiOx is higher than which in PANO tunnel SiOx. Therefore, we ascribe the lower Dit to the good inhibitory effects on the formation of low-valent silicon oxides during the OGO process. In a nutshell, OGO tunnel SiOx has a great potential to be applied in n-type TOPCon silicon solar cell, which may be available for global photovoltaics industry.
1 Introduction
Inhibiting electron–hole pair (EHP) recombination is regarded crucial to further improve silicon solar cell efficiency.[1-5] To this end, researchers have mainly proposed two types of strategies to mitigate photo-generated carriers' recombination and improve the minority carrier lifetime. One is covering the surface of silicon wafer with a passivation layer like SiOx,[6, 7] a-Si:H,[8, 9] etc., to complete dangling bonds, and thus reduce the density of surface states. This strategy is proposed taking into account that photo-generated carriers generally recombine following the Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) mechanism at energy levels introduced by surface states in the bandgap.[10, 11] The other is forming field passivation to reduce minority carrier density near silicon surface.[12-14] The concept of tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) silicon solar cells was proposed and showed excellent performance after adopting the above two strategies in a comprehensive way.[15, 16] It is recognized that the TOPCon solar cell is cost-efficient and well-compatible with the current passivated emitter and rear contact (PERC) solar cell production process.[17, 18] More importantly, TOPCon solar cells based on n-type silicon cannot be susceptible to light-induced degradation caused by boron-oxygen defects (BO-LID).[19, 20] Thus, the n-type TOPCon silicon solar cell has attracted much attention from both academia and industry.
Passivation contact structure of n-type TOPCon solar cells contains a stack of heavily doped polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) and tunnel SiOx.[21, 22] In the vast majority of cases, the poly-Si film is crystallized from a deposited amorphous silicon film. Nowadays, low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) and plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) are widely used technologies for the deposition of amorphous silicon film.[23-26] By contrast with the LPCVD, the PECVD is more competitive due to its advantages of versatility, higher deposition rate, slighter wrap-round deposition, and avoidable contamination on quartz tubes.[27] Note that the graphite boat is the standard carrier of the tubes in the PECVD equipment. Thus, developing a suitable fabrication process for the tunnel SiOx and to be compatible with the graphite boat is of great significance for promoting PECVD technology on a large scale.
Much attention has been paid to investigating assorted preparation methods for tunnel SiOx applied in TOPCon solar cells in the past few years.[28, 29] Indeed, thermal SiOx has the best passivation performance. However, the thermal SiOx always grows at high temperatures, and the graphite-boat is not stable in this environment.[30] With this in mind, the wet chemical oxide grown in a nitric acid bath was developed in the initial n-type TOPCon rear contact, and the superiority of its performance over partial rear contact (PRC) schemes was demonstrated.[6, 31] Thence, other improved wet chemical methods for tunnel SiOx like grown in ozonized deionized-water (DIO3),[15] in diluted hydrochloric acid solution oxidation (WCO-HCl),[32, 33] in Piranha solution (SPM),[34, 35] and so forth have been proposed one after another. However, on the one hand, wet chemical oxides are universally confronted with the problem of inhomogeneity and defects caused by low-valent silicon oxides.[28, 32, 36] On the other hand, the above methods require additional equipment if it is to be combined with PECVD technology. This undoubtedly increases the cost of production. More importantly, considering the chemical instability of the tunnel SiOx in the bare air, the ex-situ process has an adverse effect on the quality of the film. In view of this, our previous work has developed an in-line plasma-assisted N2O oxidation (PANO) method to prepare tunnel SiOx which was applied in n-type TOPCon solar cells successfully.[37] Inspired by the reported UV/O3 process for tunnel SiOx fabrication, we found that the ozone-gas oxidation (OGO) method can realize low-temperature oxidation and is also compatible with PECVD technology.[30] In this work, we report detailed electrical information of interface states about in-line prepared PANO and OGO SiOx based on n-type TOPCon solar cells. Firstly, we compare the defects preliminarily by carrier lifetime tests. Subsequently, we distinguish the interface states from the bulk defects through deep-level transient spectroscopy (DLTS) technology and obtain related electrical properties like the interface state densities (Dit) and the corresponding energy distribution. More essentially, the relationship between the low-valent silicon oxides and the interface defects is analyzed and elaborated unambiguously. The obtained results are of guide significance for the improvement of the tunnel SiOx preparation process in n-type TOPCon solar cells.
2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Morphologies of Tunnel SiOx
The microstructure images of the samples with PANO or OGO SiOx are taken using a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (TEM), as depicted in Figure 1a,b. There is an evident interface between the crystal Si (c-Si) substrate and the poly-Si layer, in which the lattice fringes are clearly visible. Therefore, we can easily distinguish amorphous SiOx and clearly observe that both the SiOx films distribute uniformly across the interface. The thickness of the PANO and OGO SiOx ranges 1.1–1.3 nm and 1.0–1.2 nm, respectively. Note that the oxide layer in this thickness range has good tunneling characteristics.[38] Furthermore, we cannot find obvious disruptions or defects like pinholes exist within the scope of observation. This indicates that both the PANO and OGO methods can obtain tunnel SiOx with good morphology integrity.

2.2 Experimental Exploration of Enhanced Passivation Mechanism
Considering that defects with recombination centers like dangling bonds cannot be visually observed in the TEM images, carrier lifetime tests are applied for further characterization. The carrier lifetime mapping, respectively, of the passivated samples with PANO and OGO SiOx fabricated on wafers I, II, and III are shown in Figure 2a. Generally, local as-grown defects may exist in the substrate silicon wafer, and additional damage may be introduced during sample preparation. Therefore, the overall uniformity is acceptable, although the measured results show a certain degree of non-uniformity that needs to be improved. In addition, we can observe that the passivated samples prepared by the OGO method on the same silicon wafer have a higher carrier lifetime than those prepared by the PANO method. Furthermore, corresponding curves of carrier lifetime versus carrier injection level are plotted in Figure 2b. The effective lifetimes of the passivated samples with PANO SiOx are 846, 942, and 1030 μs at the injection concentration of 5 × 1015 cm−3. However, the effective lifetimes of the passivated samples with OGO SiOx are 1540, 1550, and 1680 μs. Consequently, we can reasonably infer that there are less electrically active defects in the sample with OGO SiOx. Note that the preparation processes of poly-Si are identical to those of all the samples mentioned above. In view of this, we propose a speculation that it is the interface-related defects that lead to the difference in values of carrier lifetime.

With this in mind, we adopt DLTS technology to further investigate the electrical properties of defects in both samples and confirm our speculation. The principle of DLTS technology for testing the electrical properties of defects can be explained through energy band diagrams, as shown in Figure 3a. It is well known that the defect level will be filled with electrons if it resides below the Fermi level, which will be unoccupied otherwise.[39] As shown in Figure 3a, it can be seen that the intersection point of the Fermi level and the interface will move when the applied bias changes from pulse voltage Vp to reverse voltage Vr. During this process, the originally filled holes will emit into the valance band and produce a transient change in capacitance. DLTS technology is to extract defect-related electrical information like defect energy level, density of defect states, etc., by analyzing the produced capacitance transient data during temperature scan.

Note that a depletion region is necessary for the DLTS samples because the capacitance transient is based on changes in the width of the depletion region. In addition, the leakage current should be as small as possible within the bias range used in the test to ensure the accuracy of the capacitance.[40] Therefore, we choose the PN junction (poly-Si(n+)/SiOx/c-Si(p)) but not the high-low junction (poly-Si(n+)/SiOx/c-Si(n)) for DLTS tests. Note that we do not choose the structure of poly-Si(p+)/SiOx/c-Si(n) because the element doping may have an impact on the passivation effect of the tunnel SiOx, and the layer of poly-Si(n+) is the actual material used in the passivation structure for n-type TOPCon solar cells. Additionally, the type of dopant in the substrate c-Si has limited influence on the interface state density. In this work, we only change the preparation process of the tunnel SiOx layer, and the preparation process of the poly-Si is exactly the same for all samples. Therefore, the impact of the doping and annealing processes of the polysilicon layer on the PANO and OGO tunnel SiOx layers is identical. In view of this, we believe that the different effects of field passivation in interface states-related testing can be excluded.
Figure 3b,c shows the DLTS results of the sample with PANO and OGO SiOx, respectively. Herein, the prepared samples are fabricated on the same wafer. We can observe an interesting phenomenon in both Figure 3b,c; that is, the signal peak shifts to higher temperatures, and the peak value increases when the Vr value increases and the Vp value remains. This is the salient feature of the DLTS signal corresponding to the interface states and is significantly different from the bulk defects.[41] This can be interpreted from the energy band diagram, as depicted in Figure 3a. In general, the bulk defects introduce a single trap level, but the interface states introduce continuous energy levels in the bandgap of c-Si and are localized at the interface.[42, 43] The interface states are represented by continuous thin horizontal lines in Figure 3a. In the case of the Vp remains unchanged, the more and deeper energy levels will be filled by holes if the Vr value is greater, and the higher energy is needed
