Here is a summary of the study in one detailed paragraph, focusing on the information related to ozone (O3) pollutant:

This study developed an integrated model that combines ground measurement station data with Sentinel-5P satellite data to predict the concentration distribution of NO2 and O3 pollutants in Tehran, Iran. The model used the kriging interpolation method, which was validated using 70% of the stations as training data and 30% as test data. The results showed that the average monthly error for O3 pollutant decreased from 21.9 to 2.53%, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.86 ppb, outperforming Sentinel-5P satellite output maps. Additionally, the RMSE index of the proposed model was significantly lower than that of Sentinel-5P satellite data for O3 pollutant. The study demonstrated the effectiveness of using an integrated approach combining ground and satellite data to predict ozone concentration distribution with high spatial resolution (approximately one kilometer) and accuracy.
