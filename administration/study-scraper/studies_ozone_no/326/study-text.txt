Abstract
The need for global energy conservation has become more urgent because of the negative effects of excessive energy use, such as higher fuel consumption, greater environmental pollution, and depletion of the ozone layer. There has been a significant increase in the demand for central and high-capacity household air conditioning systems in Muscat in recent years. The need for this is influenced by factors such as arid climate, increasing temperatures, air pollution, and population increase. As a result, there has been a significant increase in electricity use, putting a strain on power resources. To tackle this difficulty, the incorporation of solar collectors as supplementary thermal compressors in air conditioning systems offers a chance to utilise renewable energy sources. The objective of this hybrid technique is to enhance the effectiveness of cooling systems, hence minimising the need for electricity, and lowering the release of environmental pollutants.

Comprehensive seismic loss model of Tehran, Iran in the case of Mosha fault seismic scenario using stochastic finite-fault method
This paper presents the results of a study caried out to assess probable seismic loss, in term of damage to the residential buildings and the number of fatalities, in the case of Mosha Fault seismic scenario in Tehran, Iran. Accordingly, seismic risk components (including seismic hazard, exposure model and fragility curves) are evaluated. The stochastic finite-fault method with dynamic corner frequency is applied for quantifying ground motion values. The results shows that PGA on the soil surface could range between 0.1 g to 0.45 g. Then, a reliable model of building exposure by analyzing census data from Tehran is compiled. This model included 19 different classes of buildings and is used to evaluate the potential damage to buildings from seismic scenario. The results indicate that the median of damage ratio from 100,000 iterations for the whole of the city is about 6% ± 1.54%. The study found that the central and eastern parts of Tehran are the most vulnerable areas, with an estimated 15,952 residents at risk of losing their lives in this scenario. This is equivalent to 0.2 percent of total population of Tehran. The finding from this study can be used by local authorities to provide appropriate emergency-response and preparedness plans in the case of Mosha Fault seismic scenario.
Considerations for the effective management of LANs in hospital buildings
According to a joint survey conducted by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications and the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare of Japan, over 90% of Japanese hospitals have introduced wireless LAN. However, about half of the hospitals that have wireless LANs have reported having experienced problems, with the most common cause being inappropriate management of signal propagation. Other factors include an excessive number of terminals connected to one AP, an information load that approaches or exceeds the limits of the network’s capacity, and a lack of information sharing during design and construction. There is also a move towards converting in-hospital PHS, which has been used mainly for nurse calls, to smartphones, which also provide voice communication over a wireless LAN. Furthermore, the number of medical devices with wireless LAN communication functions is increasing. In recent years, issues have emerged regarding the coexistence of wireless LANs used by patients. This includes security aspects, as with problematic operation of wireless LANs. The above could become even more significant considerations in future wireless LAN utilization. In this paper, we summarize issues we have identified, clarify their causes, and present possible future problems and current and future measures to be taken for their solution.
Digital transformation of quality management in the construction industry during the execution phase by integration of building information modeling (BIM) and cloud computing
The quality of construction projects significantly impacts social and economic development. However, low quality and project failure often result from factors such as lack of quality procedures, poor communication, task coordination, and inefficient progress monitoring. This research aims to improve the efficiency of the construction phase by creating quality control checklists for processes and enhancing quality management through a collaborative digital environment integrating building information modeling (BIM) and cloud computing. Expert constructive interviews were first conducted to define a construction process quality control procedure to be linked to the 3DBIM model and then transition to a collaborative cloud environment (Autodesk Construction Cloud). An actual instance in Latakia City (Syria) demonstrated that the proposed methodology improves the efficiency and effectiveness of quality management during the implementation phase. It does so by offering a robust database, enhancing on-site quality information extraction from BIM models using smartphones, documenting defects and entering inspection data directly into a shared digital environment, and making it easier to track corrective actions and feedback. This facilitates constant and organized access to current data, reducing errors and rework, saving money and
