The results showed that time, pH, and amount of catalyst are the influencing parameters on dye removal. The optimal conditions for these variables were identified as pH 2.27, 8.6 mg of catalyst, ozone concentration of 0.2 mg/LÂ·h-1, at 26 min. Under these conditions, 99.3% of the Acid Blue 113 dye was removed by the photocatalytic ozonation process. The nanocatalyst also demonstrated high reusability and stability (92%) after eight consecutive cycles.
