Here is a summary of the study in one detailed paragraph focusing on ozone data:

Tropospheric ozone plays a crucial role in climate change and air pollution, with its variations associated with human activities. The study highlights the significance of satellite remote sensing technology for monitoring global and regional spatio-temporal characteristics of tropospheric ozone, enabling quantitative analysis and investigation of formation mechanisms. While significant progress has been made in product accuracy and spatial-temporal resolution, the precision of tropospheric ozone products remains inadequate due to faint signals in the lower atmosphere, intricate surface properties, and cloud-aerosol interactions. The study emphasizes the importance of reliable observation data on a global and regional scale, with total ozone and vertical profiles being key indicators. Additionally, it notes that ozone in the troposphere is primarily generated through photochemical reactions involving nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), with these precursors being closely linked to human activities and climate change.
