The study's results highlight the challenges of disentangling the chemistry and transport impacts of the QBO on stratospheric ozone. The authors note that E3SMv2 cannot predict the timing of phase shifts in the QBO, but it does match climatological patterns observed in the period 1979-2020. They also emphasize the importance of considering both nonlinear and linear processes in simulating QBO-ozone interactions.
