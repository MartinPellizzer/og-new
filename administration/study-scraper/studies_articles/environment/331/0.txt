Carbon fibre-reinforced composites have gained significant attention in various industrial applications due to their exceptional mechanical properties. The interfacial bonding between carbon fibres and matrix materials plays a crucial role in determining the overall performance of these composites. However, the hydrophobic nature of carbon fibre surfaces hinders effective interfacial bonding with the matrix. To overcome this challenge, researchers have employed various surface modification techniques to facilitate the formation of functional groups. This study investigates the influence of ozone treatment on the interfacial and mechanical properties of desized and sized carbon fibres.
