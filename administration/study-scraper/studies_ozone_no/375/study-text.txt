Abstract
The marine industry extensively uses 3D printing to produce improved ships, boats, and other parts. How the production was implemented in marine transportation: The marine environment has been severely impacted by plastic pollution and petroleum transportation pollution over the past few decades, endangering the ozone layer and marine life. We must use 3D printing to manufacture boats and ships from plastic waste to preserve the marine environment and prevent major hazards. 3D printing is a technology used in the marine industry that reduces pollution through polylactic acid (PLA), polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), and bio-friendly based polyamide (bio-PA). Polyhydrobutyrate was analysed. Polyhydric butyrate was chosen because of how quickly it biodegrades in marine conditions. To measure the effects of the suggested activities on the marine environment, a life cycle assessment (LCA) from birth to death. Most people who eat seafood worldwide can naturally consume all marine debris. Still, the majority of plastic waste is discarded into the ocean during shipping, which can automatically cause plastic pollution in marine life. Since plastic pollution is one of the biggest risks to marine life, eating seafood can lead to cancer or other diseases in many people, so additive manufacturing and 3D printing is the best solution to reduce environmental pollution in the ocean and shield all injuries from sea living beings.
