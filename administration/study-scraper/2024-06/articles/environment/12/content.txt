Here are the five detailed paragraphs based on the scientific study:

**Paragraph 1**
The removal of sulfur compounds from fuel is a crucial step in producing high-quality diesel and gasoline. The conventional methods of desulfurization, such as hydrotreating and adsorption, have their limitations and are often energy-intensive and expensive. In recent years, non-thermal plasma technology has emerged as a promising alternative for the oxidative desulfurization of fuel. This study investigates the efficiency of non-thermal plasma in removing organo-sulfur compounds from a model fuel.

**Paragraph 2**
The experiment involved ozone generation through dielectric barrier discharge and subsequent extraction using acetonitrile. The reaction was carried out at various conditions, including voltage, temperature, duration, and flow rate. The optimal conditions were found to be a voltage of 11KV, temperature of 50Â°C, duration of 4 hours, and a flow rate of 75 ml/min.

**Paragraph 3**
The results demonstrated the efficient oxidation and removal of dibenzothiophene and benzothiophene by non-thermal plasma. The desulfurization efficiency reached 93.78% under the optimum conditions. The extracted sulfur-containing compounds were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, which confirmed the presence of dibenzothiophene and benzothiophene.

**Paragraph 4**
The high desulfurization efficiency achieved in this study highlights the potential of non-thermal plasma technology for the oxidative desulfurization of fuel. The results also indicate that the optimal conditions play a crucial role in achieving maximum desulfurization efficiency. Further studies are needed to explore the scalability and feasibility of this technology.

**Paragraph 5**
In conclusion, the present study demonstrates the effectiveness of non-thermal plasma technology for the oxidative desulfurization of model fuel containing organo-sulfur compounds. The optimal conditions achieved in this study can be used as a guideline for future experiments. The development of non-thermal plasma technology has the potential to revolutionize the refining industry by providing an efficient and cost-effective method for removing sulfur compounds from fuel, thereby reducing environmental pollution and improving the quality of petroleum products.
