    "abstract": "The increasing amount of farmed fish cannot be easily absorbed by the market as only fresh fish. The production and promotion of value-added fresh and processed fish products, which could fulfil consumers' present demands, may represent a solution to this problem. The aim of this paper is to review some of the most recent technologies, such as surface decontamination, use of \"natural\" additives and compounds, active packaging, used or experimented with to prolong shelf life, while ensuring the safety of fresh fish and fishery products."
