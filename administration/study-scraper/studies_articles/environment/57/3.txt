The observed recovery of ozone is attributed to a decrease in stratospheric chlorine loading and upper stratospheric cooling, which slows gas-phase ozone destruction cycles and enhances ter-molecular reaction producing ozone. The study also highlights the impact of COVID-19-related lockdowns on tropospheric ozone concentrations, which were significantly lower in 2020 due to reduced precursor emissions.
