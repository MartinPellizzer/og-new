Abstract
23

Ozone stands out as a crucial trace gas within the Earth’s atmosphere, exerting a significant
24

influence on climate change and air pollution.
 Tropospheric ozone plays an important role in
25

the formation of photochemical smog, and its variations are associated with human activities.
26

The utilization of satellite remote sensing technology for tropospheric ozone monitoring enables
27

a quantitative analysis of its global and regional spatio-temporal characteristics. It also facili-
28

tates the investigation of the mechanisms involved in ozone formation within the troposphere.

The significant progress in product accuracy and spatial-temporal resolution of ozone remote

sensing products, including total ozone and vertical profiles, can be attributed to the extensive
31

development of satellite remote sensing techniques. Nevertheless, the precision of tropospheric
32

ozone products remains inadequate for contemporary scientific purposes, primarily because of
33

faint signals in the lower atmosphere, the intricate nature of the underlying surface, and the exis-
34

tence of clouds and aerosols. This study emphasizes the satellite remote sensing of tropospheric
35

ozone, encompassing a comprehensive review of the advancements in satellite sensors and the
36

characteristics and suitability of various retrieval algorithms.
 Moreover, this research delves
37

into the possible utilization of satellite remote sensing for the provision of reliable tropospheric
38

ozone observation data on a global and regional level.

 Introduction
40

Ozone (O
3
) is one of the most important trace gases in the Earth’s atmosphere, which plays a crucial
41

role in climate change and ecology. Stratospheric ozone accounts for about 90 % of the total ozone
42

in the Earth’s atmosphere and protects Earth’s organisms from ultraviolet radiation. Although it
43

accounts for only 10 % of the total amount, tropospheric ozone is closely related to human activities
44

and climate change [1–3].
 Figure 1 illustrates the chemical and physical processes involved in the
45

evolution of tropospheric ozone from the 2000s to the 2020s.
 Ozone in the troposphere is mainly
46

generated by photochemical reactions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds
47

(VOCs), and is associated with weather processes such as stratosphere-troposphere exchange and
48

regional transport of ozone and its precursors [4–8]. NOx, CO, and VOCs are considered as precur-
49

sors of ozone. In contrast to the protective role of stratospheric ozone, tropospheric ozone appears to
50

be more harmful to life on Earth. Tropospheric ozone acts as a phytotoxin, which affects crop yields,
51

jeopardizes food security, and reduces the primary productivity of ecosystems. In addition, tropo-
52

spheric ozone is a significant pollutant that causes respiratory diseases, along with PM
2
.
5
. In recent
53

years, there has been a noticeable increase in tropospheric ozone pollution in densely populated
54

areas worldwide. Tropospheric ozone is now the primary pollutant affecting summer air quality in
55

major economically developed regions in China, such as Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, Yangtze River Delta,
56

Pearl River Delta, and Sichuan-Chongqing, and has become a crucial factor hindering the sustained
57

improvement of China’s air quality [9–13].
58

Therefore, rapid and accurate monitoring of atmospheric ozone concentration, as well as its spa-
59

tial and temporal distribution, is fundamental to the study of its environmental and climatic effects.
60

There are two general approaches to making atmospheric measurements:
 in-situ
 and remote sensing
61

techniques.
 In-situ
 measurements from ozonesondes are often used as the true value of ozone profiles,
62

because they are usually very specific and accurate and do not require a precise understanding of
63

the radiative properties of the atmosphere, such as are needed for remote sensing. These measure-
64

ments can be typically obtained from data networks such as SHADOZ (Southern Hemisphere Addi-
65

tional Ozonesondes) and WOUDC (World Ozone and Ultraviolet Radiation Data Center). Figure 2
66

shows the major SHADOZ (

) and WOUDC
67

(

) ozonesonde stations distributed around the world, with the
68

SHADOZ and WOUDC sites identified as orange and blue dots, respectively.
