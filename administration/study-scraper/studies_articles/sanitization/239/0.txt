The tailoring of optical and electronic properties in two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) has gained significant attention in recent years. UV-ozone (UV-O3) exposure and Focused Ion Beam (FIB) have shown great potential in material/surface modification and defect engineering in TMDCs. Understanding the effects of defects on their optical and electronic properties is crucial for advancing this field. This study aims to investigate the impact of UV-O3 exposure on the optical and electrical properties of suspended and flat 2D TMDCs.
