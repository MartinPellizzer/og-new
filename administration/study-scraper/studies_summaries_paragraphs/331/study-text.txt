Here is a summary of the study in one paragraph, focusing on the information and data related to ozone:

The study examines the influence of surface modifications on interfacial and mechanical properties in fibre-reinforced composites. Specifically, it investigates the effects of ozonation on desized and sized carbon fibres using techniques such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), atomic force microscopy (AFM), Raman spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results show that ozonation significantly transforms epoxy groups into hydroxyl and carboxyl functional groups, with an increase in carboxyl groups from 1.27 to 8.12% in the desized carbon fibre sample after 60 minutes of ozone treatment at 5 L/min. Additionally, ozonation leads to a significant increase in interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) and tensile strength of both desized and sized carbon fibres, with ILSS values increasing from 41 MPa to 64 MPa and tensile strength increasing from 772 to 831 MPa.
