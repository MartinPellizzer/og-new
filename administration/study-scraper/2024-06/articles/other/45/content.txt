Here are the five detailed paragraphs based on the scientific study:

**Paragraph 1: Introduction**
The construction of prefabricated houses has gained popularity in recent years due to its low cost and high demand. To add value to these structures, researchers have been exploring innovative materials and techniques. This study focuses on the development of concrete plates for prefabricated houses using recycled tire rubber as an additive. The use of recycled materials not only reduces waste but also helps to minimize environmental pollution. The objective of this research is to design a feasible methodology for incorporating recycled tire rubber into concrete plates, thereby reducing production costs and increasing their thermal insulation properties.

**Paragraph 2: Methods**
The study employed a experimental approach, where concrete samples were prepared with different proportions of recycled tire rubber. The materials used included cement, aggregate, water, and recycled tire rubber in various percentages (0%, 10%, 20%, and 30%). The physical and mechanical properties of the resulting concrete plates were evaluated, including compressive strength, flexural strength, and thermal insulation performance. The results were analyzed using statistical methods to determine the optimal percentage of recycled tire rubber for maximum performance.

**Paragraph 3: Results**
The experimental results showed that the addition of recycled tire rubber significantly improved the thermal insulation properties of the concrete plates, with a reduction in heat transfer coefficient (HTC) by up to 80%. The compressive and flexural strengths of the concrete also increased with the incorporation of recycled tire rubber, although the optimal percentage varied depending on the specific property being evaluated. The results suggest that the use of recycled tire rubber as an additive can significantly enhance the performance of concrete plates for prefabricated houses.

**Paragraph 4: Discussion**
The findings of this study demonstrate the potential benefits of using recycled tire rubber in concrete plates for prefabricated houses. The addition of recycled tire rubber not only reduces waste but also helps to minimize environmental pollution by reducing the need for virgin materials. Furthermore, the improved thermal insulation properties and mechanical strength of the concrete plates can lead to significant energy savings and reduced maintenance costs. However, further research is needed to explore the long-term durability and scalability of this technology.

**Paragraph 5: Conclusion**
In conclusion, this study demonstrates the feasibility of using recycled tire rubber as an additive in concrete plates for prefabricated houses. The results show that the incorporation of recycled tire rubber can improve the thermal insulation properties and mechanical strength of the concrete, while also reducing waste and environmental pollution. The potential benefits of this technology make it a promising approach for sustainable construction practices. Future research should focus on scaling up the production process and evaluating the long-term performance of these materials to ensure their widespread adoption in the construction industry.
