Global climate change is a pressing issue that has significant impacts on agricultural productivity and crop quality. Rising ground-level ozone (O3) concentrations and air temperatures are two critical characteristics of this phenomenon. The lodging resistance of rice, a staple crop for millions of people around the world, is particularly vulnerable to these changes. This study aimed to investigate the interactive effects of elevated O3, warming, and their interactions on the stem lodging resistance of rice under fully open-field conditions.
