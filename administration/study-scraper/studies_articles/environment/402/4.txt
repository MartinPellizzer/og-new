In conclusion, this study highlights the unheralded contributions of BVOC emissions from UGS to ozone pollution in urban areas. The results suggest that selecting low-emission vegetation and refining vegetation classification in urban planning are crucial for mitigating O3 levels. Furthermore, our findings highlight the need to consider regional transport of pollutants when evaluating the impacts of UGS on air quality. Overall, this study emphasizes the importance of integrating BVOC emissions from UGS into air quality models to better understand and predict urban atmospheric pollution.
