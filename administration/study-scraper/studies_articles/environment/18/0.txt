The depletion of ozone in the stratosphere is a pressing environmental issue that has been addressed through international agreements such as the Montreal Protocol. This protocol aimed to phase out ozone-depleting substances (ODS), including chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), and carbon tetrachloride, among others. In this study, we examine the environmental policies and countermeasures implemented by Taiwan over the last 30 years to phase out ODS and mitigate their impact on the ozone layer.
