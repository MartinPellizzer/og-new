In conclusion, this study highlights the importance of monitoring UV radiation levels in large cities like Tehran, particularly in regions prone to increased UV radiation due to climate change. The results provide valuable insights into the seasonal and altitude-dependent variations of UV Erythema radiation, emphasizing the need for protective measures against excessive UV radiation exposure. Future studies can extend this research to other large cities in southern Iran to further understand the impact of climate change on UV radiation levels.
