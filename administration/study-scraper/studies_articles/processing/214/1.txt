The pre-oxidation experiments were carried out at different pH levels and used two raw materials for ozone generation: air and O2. The slurry obtained from each experiment was filtered, and the filtrate was analyzed for the concentration of dissolved Cu, Fe, and Zn using atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS). The residue from each experiment was then leached by cyanidation to obtain a pregnant leaching solution (PLS), which was also analyzed for its gold concentration using AAS. The experiments were conducted at room temperature and atmospheric pressure.
