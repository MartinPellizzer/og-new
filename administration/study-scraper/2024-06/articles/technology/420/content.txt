**Paragraph 1: Introduction**
The study aimed to evaluate and compare postoperative pain (PP) in single-visit nonsurgical endodontic retreatment (SV NSER) using ozonated or nonozonated, 0.1% octenidine (OCT), and 2% chlorhexidine (CHX) with or without 5.25% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) application in teeth with post-treatment apical periodontitis. Despite significant advancements in endodontic disinfection, root canal reinfections remain common, highlighting the need for optimal irrigation regimens to prevent further rise.

**Paragraph 2: Methods**
The study was conducted as a randomized, parallel, prospective, double-blind clinical trial. One hundred and thirty-two single-rooted, root-filled teeth with symptomatic apical periodontitis were randomly allocated into six groups: CHX with NaOCl, ozonated CHX without NaOCl, ozonated CHX with NaOCl, OCT with NaOCl, ozonated OCT without NaOCl, and ozonated OCT with NaOCl. Standard NSER protocol was followed, with irrigation using the assigned irrigant for 3-5 minutes with ultrasonic agitation. PP at baseline, after 6, 12, 24, 48 h, and 7 days was recorded using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS).

**Paragraph 3: Results**
The study found that ozonated OCT, CHX irrigation, and NaOCl resulted in lesser PP at all time intervals. The VAS score after 6 hours was highest for ozonated CHX and lowest for ozonated OCT with NaOCl. Ozonated OCTH and OCHXH groups demonstrated statistically significant reductions in VAS scores at various time intervals.

**Paragraph 4: Discussion**
The study highlights the importance of optimal irrigation regimens to prevent postoperative pain in endodontic retreatment. The results suggest that ozonated OCT, CHX irrigation, and NaOCl may be a promising combination for reducing PP. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings and explore the mechanisms underlying the efficacy of this combination.

**Paragraph 5: Conclusions**
In conclusion, single-visit nonsurgical endodontic retreatment with ozonated OCT, CHX irrigation, and NaOCl resulted in lesser postoperative pain at all time intervals. The results provide evidence for the potential benefits of this combination in reducing PP and highlight the need for further research to confirm these findings and explore its clinical applications.
