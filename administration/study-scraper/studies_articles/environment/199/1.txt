To conduct this study, researchers used a dataset covering the period from 2012 to 2022 sourced from the London Air Quality Network (LAQN). Hourly concentrations of NO, NO2, and O3 were explored using the R programming language and the openair package. The data was examined for daily, weekly, seasonal, and annual patterns to identify trends and correlations between the pollutants.
