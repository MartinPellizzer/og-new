The results showed that the photocatalytic process integrating magnetic nanocomposites with TiO2 or ZnO was highly effective in removing micropollutants from wastewater. The removal efficiencies ranged from 80% to 95%, depending on the type of pollutant and operating conditions. The use of TiO2 resulted in slightly higher removal efficiencies than ZnO, but both materials showed promising results.
