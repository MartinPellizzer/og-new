Abstract
With the vigorous development of Chinaâ€™s iron and steel industry and the introduction of ultra-low emission policies, the emission of pollutants such as SO2 and NOx has received unprecedented attention. At present, the commonly used denitrification methods include selective catalytic reduction (SCR), active coke, etc. As a newly developed denitrification technology, oxidation denitrification is not widely used, and the technical level is mixed, and there might be problems such as yellow smoke, secondary pollution and ozone escape in the practical application. In this paper, problems existing in the denitrification process of sintering flue gas oxidation are analyzed, and a 320 m2 sintering machine is taken as an example. Comparing the denitrification technology of sintering industry, it could be seen that the denitrification technology route of oxidation method has low pollution, low cost and high comprehensive environmental benefits, and has greatly potential development.
