The human aging process is a complex phenomenon that has been extensively studied in various fields of biology and medicine. One of the key biomarkers for assessing cellular aging is telomere length, which plays a vital role in determining cellular fate. Telomeres are repetitive sequences of DNA found at the ends of each chromosome, and their shortening may contribute to accelerated aging and age-related degenerative diseases. As such, anti-aging treatments have emerged as potential interventions to increase telomere length and improve overall quality of life.
