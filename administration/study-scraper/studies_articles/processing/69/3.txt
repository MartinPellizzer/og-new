The results suggest that adding ozone to sodium perborate can accelerate dental bleaching, reducing the number of clinical sessions required. The increased color variation observed in PNaOZ may be attributed to the oxidative properties of ozone, which can enhance the bleaching effect. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings and explore the optimal concentration of ozone for internal dental whitening.
