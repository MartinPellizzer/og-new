Here is a summarized paragraph focusing on ozone-related information and data within the 60-80 word limit:

The study highlights the benefits of ozone (O3) in combination with biological activated carbon (BAC) as pretreatment to membrane-based advanced treatment for direct potable reuse. Ozone/BAC significantly reduces chemical peaks and low molecular weight compounds, improving water quality. The process benefits include reduced operating pressures and chemical use for membrane systems, resulting in lower costs and similar economic viability compared to indirect potable reuse trains over a 30-year basis.
