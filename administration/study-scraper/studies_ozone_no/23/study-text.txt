Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic impacted the solar power industry, business, and supply chain for 2019–2021, and installations are falling behind the mission plan. However, Indian PV manufacturers see it as a chance to engage in solar manufacturing to establish a competitive, sustainable, and robust domestic solar industry instead of import-based installations. Given the country's current environmental concerns, green and sustainable local manufacturing is the only viable alternative. By conducting a life cycle assessment (LCA), this study compared the environmental impacts generated by the five most promising photovoltaic technologies-mono-silicon, polysilicon, copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS), cadmium telluride (CdTe), and passivated emitter and rear contact (PERC) solar modules considering manufacturing in India. The study utilizes the ReCiPe method supported by Ecoinvent 3 databases and Simapro V9.0 software, and the functional unit for the data collection is in ‘per square meter’, which is later converted to ‘per kWh’ standard for comparison with the existing studies. The system boundary selected is from cradle to gate. The results demonstrate that cadmium telluride (CdTe) is the best technology for Indian climatic conditions in terms of environmental impact, with a global warming potential of 0.015 kg CO2 eq/kWh, stratospheric ozone depletion of 5.41E-09 kg CFC11 eq/kWh, human carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic toxicity of 6.67E-04 kg 1,4-DCB/kWh and 1.48E-02 kg 1,4-DCB/kWh, respectively and fine particulate matter formation of 3.96E-05 kg PM 2.5 eq/kWh assuming a lifetime of 25 years for these modules. CIGS follows CdTe in almost every environmental impact category.

1. Introduction
Solar energy harvesting is playing an increasingly important role in the global energy transition, with installed solar capacity in 2023 exceeding the combined capacity of some other renewable energy technologies like wind, biomass etc. Developing countries such as India have also made significant efforts in this direction over the last decade to ensure the continued growth of the solar energy sector to meet out the growing population's ever-increasing energy demands. In this regard, solar power capacity in India has increased from 1 GW in 2012 to 61.97 GW as of November 30, 2022, while the Levelized cost of energy for solar power has decreased from Rs. 17 in 2010 to Rs. 2.44 in 2019 [1 USD ∼ 46 INR (2010); 1 USD ∼ 72 INR (2019)] (
Agency, 2006
) (
IRENA, 2019
). The installed capacity has surpassed 40 GW as of October 2022 (

).

).
During these years (2010–2020), India, the world's fastest-growing country with a population of around 1.4 billion people, was on the path of energy transformation with many plans in place (
Reece, 2003
). The government aggressively pursued clean energy installations, investment, and clean energy for decarbonization to meet the commitments of the Paris and Copenhagen climate agreements. For this purpose, the government has implemented several solar schemes, some of which are listed in
Table 1
.

Schemes | Ministry of New and Renewable Energy and Government of India. Governmen of India, 2022
).
Scheme Year Mission
Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission 2015 The objective of this solar scheme is to establish India as a global leader in the solar sector by creating the policy conditions. The Mission has set the ambitious target of deploying 20 GW of grid-connected solar power by 2022, which was revised to 100 GW by 2022 during June 2015.
Development of Solar Park Scheme 2014 MNRE proposes the financial assistant by the government to establish and facilitate the infrastructure for setting up solar parks in various states with capacity greater than 500 kW. It proposes the development of at least 25 parks with capacity of minimum 20 GW.
SECI scheme 2011 The main objective is to engage in the development of large scale and rooftop solar projects, channelize the investment in the government sector, implement MNRE and VGF schemes, project management consultancy and trading of solar power. SECI has also played a major part in installing rooftop solar power plant.
With these schemes, India experienced a significant increase in solar installations until 2019 and early 2020, when COVID-19 hit India. Before the pandemic, 2020 was expected to be a growth year for India's solar installations. However, the scenarios have changed in the last two years (mid-2020 to early 2022) due to the pandemic effect, and continuous regression in the solar power sector has been observed. The COVID-19 outbreak affected the global solar supply chain of solar equipment. India imports more than 80% of its solar cells and modules and other manufacturing equipment such as raw materials, inverters, BOS equipment, etc. (
Hairat and Ghosh, 2017
) (
Pimpalkhare, 2020
). According to CRISIL reports, this caused a delay in installing approximately 3 GW of solar projects in India with a net worth of INR 160 billion, which were scheduled to be installed in 2020 (
CRISIL, 2020
). As a result, the pandemic has caused several setbacks for this sector, lowering India's installation estimates by 26 % for 2020 (
BRIDGE TO INDIA
).
However, as the saying goes, “every problem has an equal or greater opportunity." This is also significant for the Indian solar power sector, as according to a report, solar equipment imports fell by 79 % between April and October 2020, compared to the same period last year (
India's Solar Import
). The decrease in imports presents an opportunity for Indian solar manufacturers. Manufacturers see opportunities to invest in the production of solar cells and modules. To encourage domestic manufacturing, the government, on the other hand, has imposed tariff and non-tariff barriers, such as a safeguard duty on solar cells and imported modules (
India's solar cells
). Other steps taken to promote solar manufacturing as part of the 'Self Reliance India' and 'Make in India' plans include the Special Incentive Package Scheme (M-SIPS), preference for local suppliers, the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme, domestic content requirements, and many more (
India's solar cells
).
Due to net-zero commitments made at COP-26, many countries have expressed interest in solar PV manufacturing beginning in mid-2021 (
Shiradkar et al., 2022
). India is also pursuing green and sustainable manufacturing of solar cells to improve supply chain reliability (to mitigate disruptions similar to that occurred during the pandemic), increase energy security, and decarbonization. Aside from being economical, reducing environmental impacts during manufacturing is essential. This, in turn, will contribute to achieving the United Nations seventh Sustainable Development Goal (SDG), 'affordable and clean energy'.
Various LCA studies related to PV systems have been collected and examined in this direction.
Table 2
summarises these studies, including the technology used, the functional unit (FU), methodology, system boundaries, objective, findings etc. According to the literature, most studies are on mono-silicon and polysilicon, with global warming potential (GWP) and energy payback time (EPBT) as the most commonly evaluated impact categories (
Zhong et al., 2011
). Other important impact categories, such as human toxicity, human health, ozone depletion, etc., were almost entirely ignored in most literature (
Alizadeh and Avami, 2021
). Furthermore, among various technologies, literature on PERC technology is almost non-existent irrespective of its high conversion efficiency. Therefore, the evaluation of each technology in the solar energy for Indian scenarios is necessary and will further pave the road for implementing these technologies for various extended innovations in the field such as agri-photovoltaics (
Hamidinasab et al., 2023
) (
Ghasemi-Mobtaker et al., 2020
) etc.
