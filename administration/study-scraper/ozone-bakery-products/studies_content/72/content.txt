Advances in Wheat Breeding

Abstract
Fats contribute flavor and structure to the food, but they are sensitive to oxidation, which can lead to rancidity and off-taste. Since ancient times, antioxidants have been incorporated into foods. The utilization of antioxidants in food has been changed by the discovery of synthetic antioxidants. The effect of these antioxidants on the shelf life of bread products was evaluated and found to be effective. Experiments on animals have revealed that certain synthetic antioxidants are toxic, mutagenic, and carcinogenic. Consequently, there is a growing demand for the utilization of natural antioxidants in food, particularly in baked goods. Bakery items already contained natural antioxidants such as alpha-tocopherol, beta-carotene, and ascorbic acid. However, these natural antioxidants are not as effective as synthetic antioxidants in extending the shelf life of bread items. Baking processes may reduce the antioxidative action, although procedures such as encapsulation can preserve the antioxidative activity. The examination of the antioxidative properties of plant extracts like garcinia, curcumin, vanillins, and mint has been conducted, yet there appears to be a limited or non-existent number of researches focusing on their application in bread products. Therefore, there is a great deal of room for research in this direction.
