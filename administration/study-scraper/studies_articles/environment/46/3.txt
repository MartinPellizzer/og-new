The results of this study demonstrate the effectiveness of combining experimental and theoretical approaches to model the oxidation mechanism of the earth's atmosphere. The PFR model and CHEMKIN Pro software proved useful in predicting reaction rates and product distributions, while Gaussian 16 and ChemRate software provided valuable insights into the kinetic processes governing these reactions. These findings have important implications for understanding the role of atmospheric chemistry in climate change, air pollution, and other environmental issues.
