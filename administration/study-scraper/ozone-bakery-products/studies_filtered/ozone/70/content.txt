Keywords: Hazelnut oil, Lipid profile, Oil quality, Ozonation
ABSTRACT
In this study, the impact of ozonation on hazelnut oil quality was investigated. Hazelnuts were exposed to gaseous ozone at different concentrations (3.3 and 10 mg·L−1) and exposure times (30, 60, and 120 min). The fatty acid value and composition remained unchanged. β-sitosterol, campesterol, and ∆5-avenasterol contents were unaffected. With increasing ozone levels and exposure times, there was a slight rise in peroxide value and γ-tocopherol, and a decrease in α-tocopherol. The total phenolic content and antioxidant activity were lower in oil extracted from hazelnuts which had been ozonated for more than 60 min at both doses, compared to the control. Overall, the quality and composition of hazelnut oil remained stable with ozone treatments, depending on the treatment conditions.
