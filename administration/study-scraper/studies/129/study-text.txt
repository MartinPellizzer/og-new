Abstract
In an effort to replace the use of SF6 gas in high-voltage equipment, research has been conducted on more environmentally favorable alternative gases to this potent greenhouse gas. In the present study, the SO2–CO2 gas mixture is selected among all alternatives, including SF6, with the requirement to meet features such as reducing ozone depletion potential, global warming potential, being chemically stable, non-toxic, and having a having a boiling point of − 15 °C. Furthermore, aspects like material compatibility-based electrical properties such as dielectric constant, cost, and environmental impacts were taken into consideration. Consequently, a gas mixture of 30% SO2 and 70% CO2 was finally chosen. In this paper, power frequency breakdown voltage was experimentally measured under a quasi-uniform field while varying gas pressure from 0.2 to 2 bar for 5 mm and 10 mm of electrode gap, respectively. Subsequently, a synergistic coefficient is calculated for this mixture. The obtained results of PFBDV and synergism coefficient for a 30% SO2 and 70% CO2 gas mixture were compared with mixtures like SF6/N2, CF3I/N2/CO2, C3F8/CO2, C4F7N/CO2, R12/air/N2, and c-C4F8O/CO2/N2. Consequently, it emerged that the insulating characteristics of 30% SO2 and 70% CO2 are better than most of the other alternatives, along with considerable advantages like negligible environmental impact, low cost, better material compatibility, and low toxicity. These systematic investigations predominantly indicate that a gas mixture containing 30% SO2 and 70% CO2 can be employed as a substitute for SF6 in high-voltage gas-insulated equipment.
