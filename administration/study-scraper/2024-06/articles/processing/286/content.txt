**Paragraph 1**

In this study, CuO-SnO2:F mixed oxide thin films were synthesized using spray pyrolysis technique on glass substrates. The aim of this work was to investigate the improvement of ozone sensing parameters by varying the substrate temperature and optimizing the structural and optical properties of the thin films. Ozone gas sensors have gained significant attention in recent years due to their potential applications in environmental monitoring, industrial processes, and medical equipment.

**Paragraph 2**

The synthesis process involved spraying a solution containing copper and tin precursors onto glass substrates at different temperatures ranging from 300째C to 350째C. The films were then annealed at 400째C for 30 minutes to ensure complete oxidation of the metal ions. The structural properties of the thin films were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometry. Optical properties were investigated using transmission reflection spectra.

**Paragraph 3**

The results showed that the substrate temperature significantly affected the structure and optical properties of the CuO-SnO2:F mixed oxide thin films. The XRD pattern revealed the presence of both CuO monoclinic and SnO2: F tetragonal phases at higher substrate temperatures. Raman spectroscopy confirmed the formation of CuO-SnO2:F coupled oxide, while FTIR analysis revealed the presence of oxygen vacancies. The transmission reflection spectra indicated that the refractive index (n) varied from 1.5 to 2.3 and the extinction coefficient (k) decreased with increasing substrate temperature.

**Paragraph 4**

The results suggest that the CuO-SnO2:F mixed oxide thin films grown at a substrate temperature of 350째C exhibited improved ozone sensing parameters, including high sensitivity, fast response and recovery times, and low detection limit. The structural properties of the films were optimized to enhance their gas-sensing performance. The oxygen vacancies and coupling between CuO and SnO2: F phases played crucial roles in improving the sensing properties.

**Paragraph 5**

In conclusion, this study demonstrates the effectiveness of CuO-SnO2:F mixed oxide thin films as ozone gas sensors with improved sensing parameters. The optimized substrate temperature and structural properties of the films were key factors in enhancing their sensitivity and selectivity to ozone gas. These results have significant implications for the development of high-performance gas sensors for environmental monitoring, industrial processes, and medical equipment. Further research is needed to explore the potential applications of these mixed oxide thin films in different fields.
