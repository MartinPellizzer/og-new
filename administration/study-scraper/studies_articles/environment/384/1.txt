The methodology of this study involves analyzing data from six sites across Arizona, including Maricopa County, where six air quality monitoring stations were installed. The study examines O3 and NO2 levels based on day of the week and time of day, as well as during five distinct seasons: fall (September to November), winter (December to February), spring (March to May), dry summer (June), and monsoon summer (July to August). Data analysis was conducted using statistical software to identify correlations between O3 formation and precursor levels, particularly nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs).
