The results showed that air pollution induces a range of stress responses in plants, including the activation of ROS-scavenging enzymes and hormone signaling pathways. The study also identified the phenylpropanoids pathway as a key player in antioxidant biosynthesis, with transcription factors such as WRKY, AP2/ERF, and MYB playing central roles in connecting hormone signaling to antioxidant biosynthesis.
