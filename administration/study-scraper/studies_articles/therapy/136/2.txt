The results of the study showed significant differences between the control and treatment groups. Compared to the control group, the ozonated Aloe vera oil-treated groups demonstrated reduced expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, decreased neutrophil infiltration, and reduced endothelial damage. Moreover, increased levels of tumor growth factor beta, platelet-derived growth factor, and fibroblast count were observed in these groups. These findings suggest that ozonated Aloe vera oil can accelerate wound healing by reducing inflammation and promoting tissue repair.
