The study found consistent trends in stratospheric ozone profiles across different observational records, with a focus on the post-2000 recovery period. In the mid-to-upper stratosphere, Northern Hemispheric Umkehr records from Arosa/Davos, OHP, and MLO showed positive trends peaking at ~+2 %/decade. Upper stratospheric ozone trends derived from COH satellite records were more positive but still within two-sigma uncertainty. In the lower stratosphere, trends were mostly negative, but with larger uncertainties.
