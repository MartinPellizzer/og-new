Here is a detailed summary of the study in 1 paragraph, focusing on ozone-related information and data:

The study profiles endogenous airway proteases and antiproteases using human airway epithelial cell cultures and ex vivo nasal epithelial lining fluid (NELF) samples. The researchers detected 48 proteases and 57 antiproteases in NELF samples from healthy human subjects, with large interindividual variability observed. Notably, they found a statistically significant increase in proteolytic cleavage of Influenza H1 peptide in nasal lavage fluid (NLF) from male smokers compared to female smokers, suggesting the potential impact of ozone exposure on airway protease activity. Overall, this study demonstrates an optimized method for probing the proteolytic environment of airway surface liquid samples using fluorogenic peptides modeling respiratory virus cleavage sites, which has implications for understanding ozone-mediated alterations in airway proteinases and antiproteinases in diseases like COPD.
