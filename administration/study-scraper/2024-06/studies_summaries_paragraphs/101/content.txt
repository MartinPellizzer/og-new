Here is a summary of the study in 1 detailed paragraph, focusing on ozone-related information and data:

The corona effect, or corona discharge, can occur around high-voltage conductors, leading to power losses in lines. Corona discharges are often used in processes such as air filtration and ozone generation. In this study, the characteristics of corona discharge were studied using a needle-plane or cylinder electrode system, with observations showing chaotic beats in the coronal current between electrodes. The occurrence of corona discharge in higher voltage lines results in power losses, which are calculated based on the volt-ampere characteristic of the crown. In alternating current, corona losses are not directly related to the discharge current but rather complex processes, and determining corona losses requires knowledge of the volt-ampere characteristic. Theoretical analysis shows that local corona losses during corona formation can be calculated using a functional P, with ro being the radius of the wire and Eb initial voltage of crown.
