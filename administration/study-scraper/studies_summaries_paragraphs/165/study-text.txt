Here is a summary of the study in 60-80 words, focusing on information and data related to ozone:

The study examined the relationship between all-cause mortality and ozone concentration in the Po Valley, Italy. Results showed that short- and long-term exposure to ozone is associated with an increased risk of mortality. The analysis used daily 8h maximum ozone concentrations and hourly resolutions to evaluate the influence of ozone on total mortality. Findings highlight the importance of considering the dynamic interplay between air pollution and climate change on human health, particularly in areas with high levels of pollution like the Po Valley.
