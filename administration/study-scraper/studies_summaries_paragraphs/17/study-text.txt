Here is a summary of the study in one paragraph, focusing on the information and data related to ozone:

The study highlights the need for a new international agreement to address the emissions from orbital spacecraft that contribute to ozone depletion. The Outer Space Treaty and the Montreal Protocol, while relevant agreements, are insufficient in regulating these emissions. The research suggests that current regulations do not provide a comprehensive solution to the problem, which is exacerbated by the growing rocket industry. The study cites epidemiological studies showing the adverse effects of ultraviolet radiation exposure on public health (A. Umar S., dan Tasduq S., 2022). Moreover, it references climate change law experts who emphasize the importance of taking action in the face of uncertainty (Cameron, James dan Jacob D. Werksman, 1991). The study concludes that a new international agreement is necessary to address this regulatory vacuum and ensure environmental protection, citing studies on stratospheric aerosol geoengineering (Lee, W.R., et al., 2021) and limits on the space launch market related to ozone depletion (Ross, Martin, et al., 2009).
