**Paragraph 1**

A recent study published in Current Pollution Reports aimed to investigate the analytical approaches used to examine ambient ozone (O3) pollution in Taiwan. The study highlighted the importance of understanding the complex formation process of O3 and its driving factors, which are crucial for efficiently managing O3 pollution. Furthermore, the review emphasized the need for advanced methods to accurately quantify the impacts of these factors.

**Paragraph 2**

To address the issue of O3 pollution, several studies employed various analytical approaches. One study used a robust causality analysis to quantify the causal influence of major factors on O3 concentrations. Another study utilized deep learning models to predict O3 concentrations and captured non-linear and long-term memory characteristics effectively. Additionally, some studies focused on non-linear time series analysis of ground-level ozone, providing greater insight into the dynamic nature of ozone pollution over time.

**Paragraph 3**

The results of these studies revealed that attaining acceptable O3 levels in Taiwan is challenging due to its geographical location, which makes it susceptible to air pollution from both local sources and distant upwind areas. The studies also highlighted the importance of eliminating seasonal variations and using advanced methods such as deep learning and non-linear time series analysis to improve the precision and accuracy of trend analyses.

**Paragraph 4**

The discussions in this study emphasized that understanding the complex formation process of O3 and its driving factors is essential for comprehensively studying the evolution of O3. Additionally, the need for developing new analytical methods and implementing existing robust methodologies was stressed. Furthermore, the importance of leveraging these approaches to enhance comprehension of O3 pollution in Taiwan and develop effective strategies to mitigate its harmful effects on air quality was underscored.

**Paragraph 5**

In conclusion, this study highlights the significance of employing advanced analytical approaches to address the issue of ambient ozone (O3) pollution in Taiwan. The results demonstrate that attaining acceptable O3 levels is challenging due to geographical location and emphasizes the importance of eliminating seasonal variations and using advanced methods such as deep learning and non-linear time series analysis. By leveraging these approaches, researchers can enhance comprehension of O3 pollution in Taiwan and develop effective strategies to mitigate its harmful effects on air quality.
