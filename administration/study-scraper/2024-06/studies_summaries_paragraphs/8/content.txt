Here is a summary of the study in 1 detailed paragraph:

The degradation of 2-(2H-benzotriazol-2-yl)-4,6-di-tert-pentylphenol (UV328), an emerging persistent organic pollutant, by an ozone (O3) and peroxymonosulfate (PMS) system was investigated. The study found that 97.0% UV328 was removed in 5 minutes with 6.4 mg/min O3 and 2 mM PMS at neutral pH, and the degradation rate was positively correlated with the concentration of oxidants. Hydroxyl radical (•OH), sulfate radical (SO4•-), and singlet oxygen (1O2) participated in the degradation process, with 1O2 playing a key role. Three degradation pathways, including dehydrogenation, cycloaddition, and hydroxylation, were proposed based on transformation intermediates and density functional theory simulations. The study also found that the O3/PMS treatment mitigated the ecological risks of UV328 through toxicity assessment.
