Here is a summary of the study in one paragraph, focusing on the information related to ozone:

In this study, photocatalytic ozonation was used to remove Acid Blue 113 dye from solution using a three-component nanocomposite Fe2O3/MgO/MoS2 as the catalyst. The results showed that time, pH, and catalyst amount were influencing parameters on dye removal. Under optimal conditions (pH 2.27, 8.6 mg of catalyst, ozone concentration of 0.2 mg/LÂ·h-1 at 26 min), 99.3% of the dye was removed. The nanocatalyst demonstrated high reusability and stability after eight consecutive cycles, indicating its potential for use in industrial dye-containing effluent treatment.
