Here are five detailed paragraphs summarizing the scientific study:

**Paragraph 1**
The development of a global air quality modeling system is crucial for understanding and predicting the impacts of atmospheric pollution on human health and the environment. The Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model has been widely used for decades, but its domain coverage was limited to regional scales. To address this limitation, researchers have developed a coupled system linking the meteorological Model for Prediction Across Scales – Atmosphere (MPAS-A) with CMAQ, known as MPASCMAQ.

**Paragraph 2**
The development of the MPASCMAQ coupled system involved configuring three different models: CMAQ (offline), WRF-CMAQ, and MPASCMAQ. The Advanced Air Quality Modelling System (AAQMS) was developed to construct each model effortlessly. The system was evaluated using two global configurations: a 120 km uniform mesh and a 92–25 km variable mesh with the finer area over North America.

**Paragraph 3**
The results of the MPASCMAQ coupled system show good scalability and reasonable performance with respect to observations. A three-year simulation (2014–2016) for the uniform mesh case showed reasonable agreement with ozone and PM2.5 concentrations from observations. The variable mesh configuration also showed reasonable performance, although there was a high bias in wintertime surface ozone across the United States.

**Paragraph 4**
The results of this study demonstrate the potential of the MPASCMAQ coupled system for global air quality modeling. However, further evaluation and refinement are needed to improve the accuracy of the model's predictions. The high bias in wintertime surface ozone highlights the need for additional research on the impacts of atmospheric chemistry and meteorology on air quality.

**Paragraph 5**
In conclusion, the development of the MPASCMAQ coupled system provides a valuable tool for global air quality modeling. The system's ability to simulate ozone and PM2.5 concentrations at multiple scales demonstrates its potential for use in policy-making and research applications. Further evaluation and refinement of the model will be necessary to ensure its accuracy and effectiveness in predicting air quality at both regional and global scales.
