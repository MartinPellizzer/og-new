**Paragraph 1 - Introduction**
The monitoring of air pollutants is crucial for assessing environmental health and identifying areas that require improvement. Passive samplers have been widely used to measure atmospheric pollutants due to their simplicity and low cost. However, they often require a long exposition time and provide only mean values, limiting their ability to capture expected or unexpected events. A new apparatus has been developed to monitor ozone and nitrogen dioxide by automatically selecting a sampling duration of 8 hours, as required by most legislation.

**Paragraph 2 - Methods**
The experiment was conducted at the Arnaldo Liberti Observatory in Central Italy, where passive samplers were used to measure ozone and nitrogen dioxide concentrations. The measurement protocol involved exposing passive samplers to programmed timing for eight hours or specific user inputs. Three replicate measurements were taken for each test, with three field blanks serving as controls. Meteorological parameters, such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed, were also recorded.

**Paragraph 3 - Results**
The results showed very low uncertainties and good comparability of the data with reference methods for both ozone and nitrogen dioxide. The instrument successfully accumulated ozone or NO2 in one passive sampler for 8 hours over each day, allowing for long-time accumulation of the 8-hour average concentration. Measurements were carried out near Rome at a rural site, with a total of five periods from September 2021 to February 2022.

**Paragraph 4 - Discussion**
The study highlights the importance of having a diffuse ozone monitoring system, especially targeted towards evaluating eight-hour data. The use of passive samplers offers a cost-effective alternative to conventional techniques for large-scale measurements. The instrument developed in this study successfully monitored ozone and nitrogen dioxide concentrations, providing a valuable tool for air quality assessment.

**Paragraph 5 - Conclusions**
In conclusion, the study demonstrates the effectiveness of using an automatic exposure instrument with passive samplers to measure ozone and nitrogen dioxide concentrations over eight hours. This approach can be used to characterise areas where limit values are expected to be exceeded and provide a cost-effective alternative to conventional methods. The results highlight the importance of having a diffuse monitoring system for ozone, particularly in areas where environmental health is a concern.
