Here is a summary of the study in 1 detailed paragraph focusing on the information related to ozone:

Ozone plays a protective role against ultraviolet irradiation in the stratosphere, but it is harmful when present in high concentrations at ground level, affecting the respiratory and cardiovascular systems. Despite this, ozone is not the only air pollutant with adverse health effects; particulate matter (PM), nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), dioxins, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and heavy metals like lead are also considered harmful to humans. These pollutants can cause respiratory problems such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma, cardiovascular events, central nervous system dysfunctions, and cutaneous diseases, resulting in a significant number of deaths worldwide.
