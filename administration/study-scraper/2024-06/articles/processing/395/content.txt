Here are five detailed paragraphs using the information and data from the scientific study:

**Paragraph 1**
The present study aimed to assess the association between ozone exposure and cardiovascular disease deaths in Nanjing, China. Ambient air pollution has become a significant global public health concern, with ozone being one of the primary pollutants involved in various atmospheric photochemical reactions. The increasing trend of ozone concentration in Nanjing, a key development city in Jiangsu Province, has raised concerns about its impact on public health.

**Paragraph 2**
The study collected daily death data covering the period from January 1st, 2013 to December 31st, 2021, and meteorological and pollution data. Daily air pollution data included concentrations of fine particular matter (PM2.5), inhalable particles (PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and ozone (O3). We developed a multi-pollutant model using the Generalized Additive Model (GAM) to investigate the impact of O3 on the number of cardiovascular disease deaths. The association between daily O3 concentration and cardiovascular disease deaths was estimated using quasi-Poisson regression.

**Paragraph 3**
The results showed that an increase of 10 μg/m3 in O3 was significantly associated with a 0.81% (95% CI: 0.49, 1.12%) increase in cardiovascular disease deaths in lag05. The correlation weakened in both the single-pollutant model and two-pollutant models, but remained more pronounced in females, the older group, and during warm seasons. From 2013 to 2021, the number of excess deaths attributed to ozone exposure in cardiovascular disease continued to rise with an increase in ozone concentration in Nanjing.

**Paragraph 4**
The study found a significant association between ozone exposure and cardiovascular disease deaths, which highlights the need for effective strategies to reduce ozone pollution. The results also suggest that the risk of death and excess deaths from cardiovascular disease due to ozone exposure increases with higher ozone concentrations. Reducing ozone concentration to meet WHO standards or lower can provide greater cardiovascular disease health benefits.

**Paragraph 5**
In conclusion, this study provides new evidence on the association between ozone exposure and cardiovascular disease deaths in Nanjing, China. The findings suggest that reducing ozone pollution could lead to a significant decrease in cardiovascular disease-related deaths. The results of this study have important implications for policy makers and public health officials, highlighting the need for effective strategies to reduce ozone pollution and improve air quality in urban areas.
