In conclusion, this study demonstrates the significance of soil nitrous acid (HONO) emissions as a driver of global ozone pollution and vegetation exposure. Climate change and fertilizer use have increased global soil HONO emissions over the past four decades, leading to significant changes in air quality and vegetation health. The findings emphasize the need for considering soil HONO emissions in future research and policy efforts aimed at mitigating global air pollution.
