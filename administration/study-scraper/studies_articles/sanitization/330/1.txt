The study employed a combination of cell counting, viability assessment, and microfluidic chip culture to examine the inactivation effect of chlorination and ozonation on biofilms and planktonic cells. QS signaling-deficient mutants of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were used to investigate the role of QS in response to disinfection. The study also analyzed gene expression using transcriptome analysis to understand the regulatory mechanisms of QS.
