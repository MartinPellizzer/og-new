The results show that the presence of orography has a significant impact on the atmospheric dynamics of TRAPPIST-1e. In particular, peak zonal jet speeds in the southern hemisphere were found to be 50-100% faster than similar jets in the northern hemisphere. This asymmetry also affects the meridional circulation, transporting equatorial material towards the south pole. Furthermore, the model predicted significant changes in atmospheric chemistry, including the accumulation of potentially lethal quantities of ozone at both the south pole and the surface.
