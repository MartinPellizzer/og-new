The study's findings have important implications for understanding and mitigating surface ozone pollution in the NCP. The results highlight the need to consider both VOCs and NOx emissions when evaluating O3 formation mechanisms and developing effective control strategies. Additionally, the optimal ratio of HCHO to NO2 for reducing O3 concentrations is estimated to be 4.66 for the NCP region.
