Extract
Under Section 109 of the United States Clean Air Act, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) promulgates evidence-based national primary ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) ‘…the attainment and maintenance of which in the judgment of the Administrator, based on such criteria and allowing an adequate margin of safety, are requisite to protect the public health’.1 Presently, NAAQS are in place for six pollutants, including ozone, which is the indicator for photochemical pollution. In this issue of the journal, Stowell and colleagues add to the evidence on ozone and public health, describing findings of a case-crossover analysis of associations of estimated maximum 8-h ozone concentration with daily visits by children to the hospital emergency departments for any cause and for specific respiratory causes.2 The study is notable for its scope, involving 42 USA facilities and ∼28 million visits, and for its findings, showing associations of ozone concentration with numbers of visits for all-causes and selected respiratory causes at levels below the current NAAQS. With restriction of the analysis to days below the NAAQS, statistically significant associations persist with ozone concentration, leading the authors to question the safety of the current US ozone standard.
